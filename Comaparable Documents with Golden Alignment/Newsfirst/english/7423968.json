The Louvre and Orsay museums were shut while staff moved artworks to safety as flood levels climbed above 6m (18ft). The Seine is set to reach as high as 6.5m and unlikely to recede over the weekend, with more downpours forecast. At least 15 people have died across central Europe as heavy rainfall caused flooding from France to Ukraine. While two people died in France, 10 were killed in southern Germany as several towns were devastated. Two more fatalities were reported in Romania and one in Belgium. Austria, the Netherlands and Poland have also been affected. Tens of thousands of people have been forced from their homes. Source : BBC"}
