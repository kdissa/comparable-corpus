United Nations Arab League envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, said on Friday that while talks between Syria’s regime and opposition had made slim progress, they had raised hopes for a solution to the country’s civil war. Brahimi said he saw some positive steps and common ground, but that the gaps between the sides remained wide. Brahimi said that the opposition delegation would be back on February 10, but President Bashar al-Assad’s delegates had told him they would have to check with Damascus before agreeing to return. He listed 10 simple points that he felt the two sides agreed on in the talks and said he thought there was more common ground than the sides recognised. But neither side has budged an inch from their main positions: the opposition wants the talks to focus on a transitional administration it says will remove Assad from power. But the government wants to talk about fighting “terrorism” – a word it uses to refer to all armed opposition groups. The sides also failed to achieve more modest aims, such as an agreement to allow aid convoys into Homs, Syria’s third largest city, where thousands of civilians are trapped with no access to food or medicine.
