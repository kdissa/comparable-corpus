Speaking at the event, the Prime Minister said that it was decided that a Kandy Highway is needed in 2002. He said: At that intance we looked at two alternatives. However, before the process concluded, the government changed. Then a proposal was made for a northern expressway. But when the people in the north were asked about it, they said that they dont need an expressway. They just asked for bus facilities and that the railway and air services be developed. Speaking further Prime Minister WickremesingheÂ said that they proposed this to President Maithripala Sirisena, and to go ahead with the Central Expressway, adding that one end of the Central Expressway will lead to Kandy while the other will lead to Dambulla. He stated that this is just one part of the programme to create a new country in 60 months."}
