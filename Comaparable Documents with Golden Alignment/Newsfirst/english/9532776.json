The decision of the two-judge bench comprising of the President of the Court of Appeal Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice H.C.J. Madawala, means that Harin Fernando, may continue to function as the Chief Minister of the Uva Province Shasheendra Rajapaksa presented a petition to court saying that he was elected as the Chief Minister at the Provincial council elections but that he was removed from his post illegally and opposition leader Harin Fernando was given his post. He requested that the ruling be quashed as the only reason Harin Fernando was appointed as the chief minister was due to 5 MPs of the Government pledging their support to him. The lawyer representing Harin Fernando argued that based on four facts, the petition could not be reviewed by court. The decision of the court was to consider one of the four preliminary objections on behalf of Harin Fernando. President’s Counsel Manohara De silva who was representing Shasheendra Rajapaksa said that he would file an appeal against the decision with the supreme court which was allowed by the court of appeal."}
