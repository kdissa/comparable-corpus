It is a significant fact because CNNIC administers security certificates for the .cn country code, as well as Chinese-language domain names, which are open to businesses registered within China. Unless one of the sites is on a white-list of legitimate domains CNNIC provides to Google, Chrome users will see a pop-up warning them about its security even though they could chose between ignoring the content or proceeding to the site. The ban comes two weeks after Google noticed unauthorized digital certificates for several Google domains that were issued through MCS Holdings, an intermediate certificate authority contracted by the CNNIC. The ban will be implemented in the future update of Google. The CNNIC explained to Google that instead of keeping the security certificate’s private key safely tucked away in a proper hardware security module, MCS Holdings installed it in a man-in-the-middle proxy, leaving it extremely vulnerable to interception."}
