Regardless of who you want to win, though, there’s one thing we can all agree on: There is a gargantuan amount of money tied to this fight! The fight itself expected to generate more than $300 million in pay-per-view revenue. According to ESPN, Mayweather can expect to clear $180 million of this, with the remaining $120 million going to Pacquiao. These predictions, mind you, are contract-based, so regardless of who wins and who loses, both fellas are making bank off this blow-out. (The winner will get extra royalties from the fight’s sponsors and future endorsements, but still, loser makes it out OK, too.)"}
