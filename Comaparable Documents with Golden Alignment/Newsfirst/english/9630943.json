The Western Provincial Councillor made this statement at an event held to provide a sound system to the Sri Nagarukhkharama Temple in Kotikawatte. UNP Western Provincial Council, S.M. Marikkar, speaking at the event expressed the following views: ‘ ‘My first proposal as a Western Provincial Councillor was to make Sunday School Education mandatory in the Western Province. I proposed for the prohibition of tuition classes on Sunday mornings until Grade 9. I believe that the Chief Minister is simply holding on to that resolution and doing nothing about it. I hope gather all the Prelates and exert some pressure to make Sunday School Education mandatory. This is a time where the parents cannot aid their children with corporal punishment, especially in Kolonnawa which has earned a reputation as the place with drugs.”"}
