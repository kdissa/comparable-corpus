Dissanayake expressed his views on the talks of a ‘National Government’ following an event in Bomure, Medamahanuwara. He stated forming a National Government is demeaning and that it is something which should not be done. “Even if they make such a decision in Parliament, the President has every right to object and disallow the number of ministers to rise above 30.” – S.B. Dissanayake, UPFA MP Min. Lakshman Kiriella made a statement to the media yesterday (Feb 3). In his statement, minister Kiriella said that a national govt. is being formed “not to increase the number of ministerial portfolios, but to contribute towards the development of Sri Lanka”. When asked for his thoughts on the statement made by min. Kiriella, MP Dissanayake stated that if such is their motive, the number of Ministers, Deputy, and State Ministers should not be increased. When questioned if a program will be implemented to defeat the budget, the MP stated that a group in the UNP itself is proposing to defeat the budget. “Some of those in the parties affiliated with the UNP have also made the same proposal,” he said."}
