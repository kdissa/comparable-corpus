His Eminence, at the Archbishop’s House in Colombo, called for the strike to be postponed,  due to the Dengue epidemic which has spread across the country. He calls on the GMOA doctors to focus on providing much-needed treatment to those affected by Dengue, instead of striking. Monday, July 3, was a normal day at work for the doctors of GMOA as they announced that they would strike, again, over SAITM. The GMOA announced that it would begin the ‘island-wide indefinite strike’ on Wednesday, July 5. As expected though, various factions of the society voiced their displeasure over the announced strike. One of them was the voice of Mahinda Amaraweera (UPFA General Secretary), who said that GMOA should be more sensitive to the plight of patients. He added that the association may not be able to continue the strike action in the face of unremitting opposition by the general public. Meanwhile, Minister S.B. Dissanayake has said that over 90% of doctors in the country are against the GMOA. He added that the association does not represent the opinion of the doctors in Sri Lanka."}
