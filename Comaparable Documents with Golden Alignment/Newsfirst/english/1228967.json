Running along this road, is untreated raw sewage.The overflowing sewage poses a deadly threat today, to people living in the area. The overflowing sewage from the drainage system, flows alongside the residence of A.K.M.S. Rajendran, former Deputy Mayor of Colombo who stated that RDA contractors cut all the pipes and the sewage flows here bringing germs. He stated that fiveÂ children are already in hospital and even vehicles have fallen into this. Having governed Colombo in the past, the former deputy mayor is in despair, with authorities yet to respond to the complaints lodged by him and the people."}
