The leader of UNP Ranil Wickremesinghe and MPs representing the UNF participated in the event. Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking to the media stated that the 19th amendment was presented during the presidential elections in 2015 by President Maithripala Sirisena to strengthen democracy in Sri Lanka. He stated that therefore as the UNF they have a duty to protect it. He went on to state that the people of this country used their mandate against Mahinda Rajapaksa twice and even after this if Mahinda Rajapaksa is appointed as the prime minister, it is an act of injustice and against the mandate of the people. UNP MP J. C. Alawathuwala stated that they claimed 95% of victory in this struggle and notes that they have the majority. While MP Harin Fernando requested the public to come forward and take to the streets and fight for democracy. The motor rally organized by the UNF demanding to uphold democracy arrived at the Seenigama temple for religious observances. The rally then proceeded towards Devinuwara Vishnu temple, marking the end of today’s rally. The rally is set to reach Mahiyanganaya tomorrow via Kataragama."}
