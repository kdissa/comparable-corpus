Still photographs from the local disaster agency and the Philippine Red Cross showed bodies being recovered during rescue operations over the weekend. Three ferries capsized in separate incidents on Saturday (August 3), which was blamed by sudden squalls. Three people remain missing, officials said. A strengthened monsoon brought by a brewing weather system near the Philippine waters has brought heavy rains in the country, the state weather bureau said, suspending schools in Manila on Friday (August 2) and Saturday."}
