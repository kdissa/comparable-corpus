However, a complaint had been filed claiming the Minister was involved in assaulting an individual. The Magistrate questioned why a case was filed against the Minister if it was not proven that he had assaulted the complainant. The CCD informed the court, that though it was not proven the Minister had assaulted the complainant, the Judicial Medical Reports suggested that the complainant had been assaulted. The CCD said it will investigate to ascertain whether the complainant was assaulted. The magistrate ordered the Police to submit a complete report before court, if charges are to be dropped against Minister Ranathunga. The case will be taken up again on the 10th of January."}
