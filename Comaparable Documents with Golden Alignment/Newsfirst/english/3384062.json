The university authorities took steps to reopen the university premises in the face of student protests. The students were severely inconvenienced when the main entrance of the university was closed by the security officials. The university authorities took this step to strengthen security in the area and officers from the Sri Lanka Army were deployed to support the security officers. The University officials decided to close down the main entrance of the university at 12 noon. News 1st Correspondent in the area noted that as the gates were opened to make way for a vehicle coming towards the university a group of students outside the gates rushed in and this caused a tense situation between the security officials and the students. In order to bring the situation under control, the security officials closed the gate once again. Speaking to the media a student noted that the vice-chancellor has turned this university into a prison. It was noted that this same vice-chancellor created issues inside the university and that he is attempting to do it once again. He added that this is a pilot project to control the students.
