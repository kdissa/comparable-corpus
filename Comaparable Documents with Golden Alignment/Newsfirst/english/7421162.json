However, the News 1st correspondent in Rameshwaram noted that Indian security forces have been put on alert to stop this effort. Fishermen in Rameshwaram conducted their protest for a ninth day on August 1 citing a number of demands, including the immediate release of Indian fishing vessels in Sri Lankan custody. According to our correspondent, fishermen from the Pamban area also joined the protest. Nearly 800 fishing vessels from the Pamban area did not set out to sea on August 1; they charge that the Indian central government has not done anything to meet their demands. Navy Media Spokesperson Commander Kosala Warnakulasuriya noted that if the Indian fishermen attempt to breach the Sri Lankan maritime boundary, necessary steps would be taken in accordance with the law."}
