Police in the Atlanta suburbBrown said that the, 21 year old  “was not breathing” when a man identified as her husband and a friend found her at about 10:25 a.m. inside her townhouse in Roswell, Georgia. They called 911 and performed CPR until public safety officers arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. Brown was taken to North Fulton Hospital, where “she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don’t know her condition,” Holland said Saturday afternoon at a press briefing. Nobody knows what caused Brown’s unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. Police had been to the residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation said Holland. The police spokeswoman noted one oddity in the case: “Her mother died in the very same manner.” It was three years ago February 11 that Brown’s mother, renowned singer Whitney Houston, was found dead in a bathtub in The Beverly Hilton, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammys bash there.
