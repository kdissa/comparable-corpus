Titled Xscape , the track listing was chosen by Epic Records chairman LA Reid, who trawled through four decades of Jackson’s demos and off-cuts.t The tracks were then updated by the likes of Timbaland, who works with Justin Timberlake, and Stargate, who have produced Rihanna and Beyonce. Reid called the process of reworking the songs “contemporizing”. A deluxe edition of the album will also feature the eight tracks in their original form alongside the remixed versions. Xscape is the only track on the album to be updated by its original producer – Rodney Jerkins, who worked on the sessions for Jackson’s final studio album, Invincible, in 2001. John Branca and John McClain, co-executors of Jackson’s estate said: [quote]He was always relevant and current. These tracks, in many ways, capture that spirit.[/quote]"}
