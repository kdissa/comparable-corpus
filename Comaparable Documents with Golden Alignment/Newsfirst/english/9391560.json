MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara went onto note that the Prime Minister who hand- picked Arjuna Mahendran has to take responsibility and cannot just brush over it and say that this is a technical matter. Speaking further, he added that he would go to the extent of saying that PM must make a statement about this and his relationship to Arjuna Mahendran, to hand-pick him to be the Governor of the Central Bank."}
