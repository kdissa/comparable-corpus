If you have not watched the movie, then we can assure you-you are missing out on a hysterical laugh. Kolamba Sanniya was directed by Manik Sandrasagara starring renowned artists Geetha Kumarasinghe, Joe Abeywickrama and Denawake Hamine among many others. A rustic villager named Andare (Joe Abeywickrama) finds a gem behind a bush in the river banks. Not knowing its value, the whole family which includes Andare’s sister (Denwaka Hamine), brother Jakolis (Eddie Jayamanne), son (Freddie Silva), and daughter (Geetha Kumarasinghe) travel to Colombo to sell the gem. Andare and family receive a hefty sum for the gem, making them purchase a bungalow in Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo 7. However, this family from a rural village soon find out that living in the town is not as easy as they thought it was. Director Manik Sandrasagara managed to perfectly capture the Andare family’s attempts at blending into the Colombo 7 lifestyle with the high-brows, both local and foreign.
