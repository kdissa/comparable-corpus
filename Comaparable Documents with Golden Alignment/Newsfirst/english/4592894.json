This suggests that the ability to cook food is deep seated and may have arisen in human ancestors millions of years ago. The conclusions also indicate that humans may have developed the ability to cook very soon after they learned how to control fire. To get at those questions, the researchers travelled to the Jane Goodall Instituteâ€™s Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Republic of Congo in the summer of 2011. They conducted a series of experiments using wild-born chimpanzees to test whether they were capable of making the mental leaps necessary for cooking. The study has been published in one of the journals of the Royal Society."}
