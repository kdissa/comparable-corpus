Mohan Peiris says that maintaining the dignity and decorum associated with the office of the Chief Justice and ensuring its respectability and propriety is his prime concern. In his statement, Mohan Peiris notes that he was appointed by a warrant to the post of Chief Justice, with the concurrence of the Parliamentary Council which comprises of government and opposition members. He says that he finds himself displaced from office due to exertions by external forces reinforced by an extra judicial chain of events. Noting that he could only be removed from the office of Chief Justice as per Article 107 (2) of the Constitution after an address of Parliament, Mohan Peiris adds that it appears that the Executive has now sought to arrogate to itself a non-existent power by usurping the power of the legislature and thus engage itself in an unconstitutional process."}
