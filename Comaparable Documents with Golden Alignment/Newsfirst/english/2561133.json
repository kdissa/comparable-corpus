The Paper notes that President Sirisena, in an interview with Ceylon Today, acknowledged that he was extremely concerned about two letters in connection with the controversial transfer of IP Nishantha Silva being leaked to various parties, including the mainstream and traditional media. The article reads that the first such letter to be made public was the one sent by IGP Jayasundara to the Defence Secretary, Hemasiri Fernando, stating that the transfer was made on orders of President Maithripala Sirisena. The second was another confidential letter sent to the IGP by the chief of CID Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne, clearing IP Nishantha Silva of allegations that he was connected to the LTTE. The article on Ceylon Today further reads that it was later revealed that President Sirisena and his allies suspected foul-play on the part of the IGP to put the President in an embarrassing situation. The article goes on to note that upon inquiry from the President whether or not any action will be taken against the IGP regarding the issue, the President had confirmed action will be taken in due course. The article quotes President Sirisena as having said “I have already given directives to lodge an official complaint with the National Police Commission in this regard.”"}
