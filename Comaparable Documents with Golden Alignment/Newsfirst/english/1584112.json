The event was held at the Apa Gama Premises in Battaramulla on Monday, January 4 . President Sirsena stated that the previous government had made a decision to release 3500 acres of land owned by the Department of Wildlife Conservation, which was regarding the resettlement of the internally displaced persons owing to the war. He went on to note that he would have opposed it if he was asked to attend the inter-ministerial meetings as he was the then Minister of Health. He added that the officials could have given lands for resettlement purposes without causing damages to the Wilpattu National Park,  by giving lands from other areas of the country. Explaining further, he added that narrow-minded decisions have led to that destruction,  and  tht allegations are made against them in a wrong manner. Earlier, the President also wished the staff of the Presidential Secretariat for the New Year, before commencing work today."}
