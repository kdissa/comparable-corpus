Issuing a message to mark the 72nd Independence Day of Sri Lanka Premadasa notes that the beating heart of our nation was and has always been the people and that the people never lost hope even when they were under colonial powers. Premadasa believes that we must remember the heroes and especially the unsung heroes, who laid down their lives to ensure our freedom adding that it is now up to us, to ensure that their struggle was not in vain. The Opposition Leader reiterated the importance of standing against attempts to disunite our people which ultimately weakens our nation. “We must never forget that our unity is our greatest strength and the bulwark against foreign intervention and influence. We must remember that freedom isn’t limited to a day. It must be fought every day. When our farmers toil under the sun to feed our nation, they are protecting our freedom. When our teachers educate the next generation, they are protecting our freedom. When our doctors go beyond the call of duty and care for our sick they are protecting our freedom. When entrepreneurs build their businesses and innovate, they are protecting our freedom. When you and I, refuse to accept corruption as a norm, then we are fighting for our freedom.” – Sajith Premadasa Premadasa concludes his message by calling on the people of the country to recommit to our unity and commit to a future where no Sri Lankan is left behind."}
