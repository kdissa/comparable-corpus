The Southeast Asian country has been holding the biggest multi-sport event outside the Olympics since Aug. 18 and apart from some long-running ticketing difficulties, the Games, which conclude on Sunday (September 2), have gone fairly smoothly. Officials said Indonesia would submit itself as a candidate to host the Games as soon as the Asian Games conclude. Should Indonesia get the opportunity to host the Summer Olympics, it would become the fourth Asian country to do so, after Japan, China and South Korea. Tokyo will host the next Summer Olympics in 2020, with Paris holding the 2024 Games and Los Angeles confirmed as hosts for four years later."}
