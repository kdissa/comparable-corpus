He stated that he has never hurt the people and has always supported them during their time of need. He went on to note that the reason for posters to be printed is because the people are hoping to elect him to Parliament. Sunil was accused of raping a 14-year-old girl in a guesthouse in Akuressa between May 23 and May 30, 2012. He was arrested by Police on July 4, 2012 and remanded for two months and 10 days before being released on bail."}
