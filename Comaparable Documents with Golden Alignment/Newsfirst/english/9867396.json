Speaking at the media briefing,  Susil Premajayantha expressed the following views: ”I heard Ranil Wickremesinghe say last week that his government will run out of oxygen on the 23rd. If the oxygen runs out and they cannot breath, then give it to us. We have oxygen and we can breathe well and take the next term. To add to that, the President is ours too. He is the President of the Party. So we can function in government.”"}
