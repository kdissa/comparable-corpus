UPFA MP, D. V. Chanaka shared his views on the prevailing power crisis in Sri Lanka. He noted that in 2014 Sri Lanka was the only country to provide power 24/7 in the South Asian region. He noted that today it is the contrary. He noted this was one of the blessings from the “Yahapalana government”. He noted that when the Hambantota port was leased to China the first-ever wind power plant in the Sri Lankan soil had to be dismantled losing Sri Lanka a major asset.  He added that a British company offered a power unit for Rs. 10.50 in 2012 and when the current government came into power they ignored the project as they would not get any commissions. He noted that the country now suffers the consequences of those misdoings as now the government has to buy a unit for a price high as Rs.30. He added that Rs. 41bn had been lost annually and altogether Rs. 120, 000mn has been lost. “The existing government would not launch any project unless there are cuts to fill their pockets” he concluded. UPFA MP, Susantha Punchinilame noted at the brief that the Triforces, the police and the STF, with the guidance of the President are fighting a war on drugs to save the country from drug menace. He added that on April 3rd, a programme will commence to eradicate the drug menace from all police divisions."}
