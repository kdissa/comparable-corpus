Can we eat and drink with no jobs? Why are they deaf and blind to this? The children of these innocent mothers have gone hungry for six months. How many such mothers are there? People around here are living off debt. They take poison when they cannot pay the interest. Is this just?” The protest caused the Matara – Tangalle road to be closed for three hours on Sunday. The protest organized by the families of Sri Lankan fishermen detained in Myanmar in October last year, was held in Kottegoda, Matara. Police requested motorists to use alternative routes due to the demonstration. The alternative route provided was the road via the Hunnadeniya junction, leading to Tangalle. However, the protesters later blocked that road too. The protesters dispersed after a co-ordinating secretary to the Minister of Fisheries promised to discuss this issue in the future and provide a solution."}
