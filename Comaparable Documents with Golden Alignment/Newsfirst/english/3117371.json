The move comes just days after the escalation of violence in disputed Kashmir between the nuclear-armed neighbours, theatre owners said on Friday. The film boycotts have been announced in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. Indian films are extremely popular in Pakistan. Last week, two Bollywood films, ‘Pink’ and ‘Banjo’, were released in the country. On Thursday a group of Indian film-makers, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association, banned Pakistani actors from working in Bollywood. Big Pakistani cinema chains and screens say they have taken a spontaneous decision not to show Indian films for at least a couple of weeks, or until what they call normality returns in relations between the two countries. They admit their cinemas may suffer financially because of the popularity of Bollywood movies in Pakistan."}
