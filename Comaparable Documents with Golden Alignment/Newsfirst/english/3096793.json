Former President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga expressed these views; [quote]A meeting was held on the 30th of December by our common candidate. I too spoke at that meeting.I spoke in English.I decided to make my speech in English because the Tamil community can understand the language, better than Sinhala. At this instance Minister Rambukwella had quoted me saying that Prabhakaran died as a hero. This is completely false. He is not a hero, he is a murderer. He is a power-hungry murderer. Today, there is also a leader in the south who is a murderer – hungry for power. We will take legal action against Rambukwella. It is a blatant lie. I addressed Prabhakaran as Mister as a means of sarcasm. The fact that they do not understand the puns in English language is not my fault. When my government came into power in 1994 the east was free, Apart from a few sections which were freed by the UNP government. It was under my government that the Jaffna peninsula was freed. However, I do not want to claim it solely as my victory. I did not put up cut outs stating that I solely did it. Army commanders and soldiers under my leadership and under my government sacrificed their lives. After securing a part victory, he is acting as if he was involved in liberating the entire country and is of the notion that the people owe their lives to the Rajapaksa’s for eternity and keep them in power. This is why I reject this. [/quote]"}
