He added that a prominent figure in their area was arrested and released yesterday and there is an element of suspicion as to what happens to the information they obtain. He noted that after such information is analyzed and compiled, they wonder if they could be informed and made aware of information regarding those behind this attack. The Archbishop urged the youth to refrain from spreading aggressive content that betrays the spirituality. Meanwhile, His Eminence also spoke regarding the rumour that he was given a bulletproof vehicle. He noted that he has been provided with such a vehicle for security and has been asked not to go out, however, when he has to travel, he gets into a vehicle that has been assigned to him by the security forces. The Archbishop said he never inquired as to whether the vehicle is bulletproof or not. He added that when he heard the rumour, he immediately said that he does not want a bulletproof vehicle and now it has been returned."}
