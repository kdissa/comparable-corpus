Excavation activities were temporarily halted due to the unavailability of certain officials who were scheduled to attend several urgent High Court proceedings. The team had been engaged in the continuous excavation duties for the last 76 days. So far 141 complete human skeletons have been unearthed. Several skeletal remains were discovered earlier this year at the proposed Sathosa construction site in the Emil-Nagar area in Mannar, subsequently leading to investigations being launched into the discovery. Senior Archaeologist Prof. Raj Somadeva of the Kelaniya University, who is participating in the investigationâ€™s forensic aspect, had previously observed that the site had shown both the methodical placements of bodies as it is in a grave as well as the irregular positioning of skeletal remains."}
