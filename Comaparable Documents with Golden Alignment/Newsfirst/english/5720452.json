Paris city officials have started to remove padlocks symbolically fastened to one of the French capital’s main bridges by loved-up couples. Tying a “love lock” on to the Pont des Arts before throwing the key into the River Seine beneath has become a tourist tradition in recent years. The city says the locks, usually hung by couples to express eternal love, are causing long-term damage to Paris heritage sites. Part of the bridge’s railings collapsed under the weight last year."}
