He questioned what could be done to restore the economy of the country. Is it the new trend of selling drugs or borrowing money that brings revenue to the country? He proposed that a set of policies should be established in order to amend the income disparity of the economy. Handunetti further said that under Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government the Enterprise Sri Lanka project was initiated. “This program is called the 4P’s (Public Private Peoples Partnership). Does the 4P’s mean that a few organizations get together and rob the government and in turn destroy the economy?” he asked. He added that the money earned by the people does not go to the treasury or the inland revenue department as it is supposed to, but goes through another route through the CEB, through the petroleum corporation, the port, SriLankan Airlines, through the road development authority, and through the water board."}
