Twenty second Lane in Colpetty, was renamed after the Late Union leader Bala Tampoe on Sunday, under the auspices of Labour Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne. After his radical proposal in June 1947, demanding union and political rights for public sector employees, Bala Tampoe was removed from public service. Undeterred, Tampoe came forward as the General Secretary of the Ceylon Mercantile, Industrial and General Workers Union, becoming a voice for the voiceless. Until the moment of his passing on September 1, 2014, Bala Tampoe stood steadfast in the fight for workers’ rights in an era where such movements had been expropriated by political parties, and is remembered as a legendary trade union leader."}
