He notes that this is a clear example which demonstrates that achieving freedom and preserving it are two different matters entirely. “When we look back upon the 72 years that have passed since we gained independence, we see some cause for satisfaction. Even in the midst of some’ serious challenges, the system of representative democracy based on universal suffrage has survived in this country. We are ahead of most countries in terms of indices relating to health and literacy. We have a free media and every citizen is assured of his personal safety.” – PM Mahinda Rajapaksa The premier notes that the challenge before us today is to restore to this country the economic progress that was lost due to bad politics.
