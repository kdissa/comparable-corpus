The event was organised by the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro and the Blue World Foundation, along with the participation of families of affected by autism. The movement also aimed to make a splash across social media platforms by launching the hashtag #acendaumaluzazul, or #lightitupblue, along with a music video drawing attention to the syndrome, entitled “Blue Selfie”. The World Health Organisation (WHO) changed the classification of autism 15 years ago, from a disease to a disorder. According to WHO, the disorder is characterised by difficulties in social interaction, communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities, across a wide spectrum of manifestations and severity. The United Nations (UN) declared the theme for the 2015 International Day for Autism Awareness “Employment: The Autism Advantage” in light of the estimate that 80 percent of adults with autism are unemployed. According to the UN, employers often overlook heightened abilities in pattern recognition and logical reasoning, and attention to detail, often shown by people on the autism spectrum.
