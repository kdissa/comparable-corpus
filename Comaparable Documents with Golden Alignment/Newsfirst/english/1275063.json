He further says that September 2nd, the day of the 63rd anniversary of the party is going to be a dangerous day because if the candidate of the Pohottuwa is announced on the 11th that no one can stop a division being created. The parliamentarian says that the SLFP presidential candidate will bring 500,000 people to Colombo on September 2nd and make a statement that the next presidential candidate will be from the SLFP. He also stated that if Dilan Perera has an issue with this that he should take the opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa and the current president and get them to discuss on the matter. MP Muthuhettigama further claims that if the issues of the party top officials are not being discussed that they cannot run a government together. He added that the SLPP should take a decision only after the UNP announces their candidate and that if it is Sajith Premadasa that the battle should be handed over to the SLFP because the SLPP could only announce their candidate but not produce a President."}
