The objective of this tour is to prepare a strong team in readiness for the next World Cup which is to be held in England in 2019. The National Chief Cricket Selector Kapila Wijegunawardene stated that it is ‘must’ to bring young blood in to the side. He added that when the next World Cup  commences in 2019 Sri Lanka has to have nurtured youngsters developed by leading players, in order to compete with the top teams. He went on to note that they have a very busy calendar leading up to July 2016, and therefore as a precursor, they have inducted five young players into the T20 side for the two internationals against Pakistan. He further stated that SLC is making use of the platform to give the opportunity to youngsters to display their talent and assess those players who can get into the senior team. Tamil Union’s left-hand batsman Charitha Buddhika will captain the team which will first play three four-day matches against South Africa Development Squad at home in Pallekele, before travelling to India. Wijegunawardene said selectors have been watching the A team and emerging teams to identify the up and coming talent who could serve the country well."}
