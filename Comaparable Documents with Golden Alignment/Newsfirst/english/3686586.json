The villagers of Himbutuwila in Dodangoda, Kalutara had to face a myriad issues due to the absence of a common area for the locals to gather during a public event. Even though alternative locations in the village were used for this purpose, it failed to stand as a successful solution.Over 400 families in the village of Dodamgoda will benefit from the community hall provided through the Gammadda movement. Naleen Ratnayake, who resides in Australia, and JAT Holdings joined hands to contribute towards this project.The winner of an art competition which was held at the event was also felicitated."}
