The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the squad on Monday (February 1). Kohli was in supreme form in the just-concluded Australia T20 series, where he scored 199 runs at an average of 199 with three half-centuries. Following his three consecutive half-centuries in Australia, Kohli dethroned Aaron Finch from the No. 1 spot in the ICC Twenty20 International Rankings released on Monday. Kohliâ€™s break seems to been have timed to keep him fresh for the World T20 comming up this March in India. Delhi left-arm spinner Pawan Negi, who used to play for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, received his first call up to the India side."}
