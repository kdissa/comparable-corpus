MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing this event stated that Ranil Wickremesinghe accepts Wasantha Senanayake and Mahinda Rajapaksa welcomes Vadvel Suresh, both who keep changing their views and crossing parties. Criticising both MR and RW, Anura Kumara questions where they are suitable leaders? After many other comments, MP Anura Kumara stated that if Ranil Wickremesinghe thinks that he can peacefully engage in politics for the rest of the one and a half years, he is mistaken.  We assure you that he would not be able to that. Ranil has no right to keep 113 and govern the country."}
