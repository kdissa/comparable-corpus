Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula Thero pointed out that regardless of the decision of the supreme court, the decision of the General public needs to be taken into account. Ven. Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula Thero stated that the majority in parliament was claimed by another political party and therefore it is important to identify who has the majority. He went on to state that it is with thorough confidence that the people of this country voted for the UNP and that nobody voted to sell shares of the country, nor did they vote in order to postpone elections. Ven. Rahula Thero stated that the parliamentarians obtain votes of the people after presenting certain principles and policies but that after they get into parliament the people are forgotten. The priest went on to note that these laws and principles must be rectified as the current actions are shameless. Ven. Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula Thero noted that in his opinion a parliament cannot go forward in the current circumstances. The speaker who was present at the event spoke to the media and stated that he is an individual who acted with much devotion towards the country. At a time the country faced terrorism, he noted that he has taken steps to put a stop for terrorism. Further explaining he stated that even in parliament, he has always acted according to his conscious and that he will continue to do so even in the future."}
