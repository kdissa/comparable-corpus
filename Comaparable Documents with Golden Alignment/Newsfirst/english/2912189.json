The event was also graced by President Maithripala Sirisena. The event was organised by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine together with the World Health Organization and Medical Trade Unions. Local representatives of the WHO and a number of local professionals also attended the event. Speaking at the event Professor Carlo Fonseka said the country has had 26 Ministers of health, the first one was S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who resigned after a short period and soon became the leader of the nation, then Maithripala Sirisena resigned as Minister of Health and as President Bandaranaike he became the head of state in an unexpected manner. Fonseka wondered out loud whether Dr. Rajitha Senaratne would also do the same, sometime in the future."}
