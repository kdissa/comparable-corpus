Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said that attention needs to be drawn to the fact that a large amount of money was given out as a loan to Perpetual Treasuries during the the CBSL Bond issue. The COPE report revealed that the Bank of Ceylon had forwarded bids at interest rates of 12.5 percent, 12.75 percent and 13 percent for 13 billion rupees as per a request of perpetual treasuries. The report goes on to say that that the working committee investigations revealed that this is the first time that a primary dealer bid on behalf of another primary dealer for central bank bonds. A heated situation arose when the group of professionals were not allowed to enter the commission. Former Parliamentarian,Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara charged that it has been three months to date but it is unknown whether the Bribery Commission has commenced an investigation into this, while those who were involved in this are at large and that there seems to be arrests that are carried out based on an agenda for political reasons. Attorney at Law Kalyananda Thiranagama said that the only matter to be investigated with regard to this issue is if the leadership of the UNP was involved in this and there is proof of their involvement. But COPE has not investigated in to this, it was pointed out. The group then protested opposite the Bribery Commission and dispersed. An official from the commission arrived there to inform them of the progress of the complaint that they lodged, however they had left by that time."}
