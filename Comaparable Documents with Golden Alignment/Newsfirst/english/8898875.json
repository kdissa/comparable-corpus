He noted that even though a UNP government was in power for the past five years, they failed to provide solutions to the problems faced by each electorate. The minister added that it is with great expectations that all UNPers hope for a president to be elected from the UNP. He said the presidential candidate should not only be a UNPer, but must also be able to win the upcoming elections. He went onto note that in his point of view, it is Minister Sajith Premadasa who has the popularity to win and it is he who possesses all the characteristics required to succeed. However, he said they do not imply that the current leader should be removed from his position. Minister Samaraweera stated that they have no issue on who comes forward as the candidate from the opposition, even if it is a Rajapaksa. He pointed out that the political struggle within the Rajapaksa family is similar to the game of musical chairs and regardless of who comes forward from the opposition, Sajith Premadasa will win. He added that in line with his victory, they should be able to carry forward the vision of Ranil Wickremesinghe and D.S. Senanayaka as well. He noted that when all political parties promote extremism, it is only the UNP that stands to uphold democracy in the country."}
