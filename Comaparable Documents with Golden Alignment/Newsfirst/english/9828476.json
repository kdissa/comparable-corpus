The Governor says that the Prime Minister never thought of handing over his power and that even around this time he is playing his old trick by forming a new alliance and appointing a leadership council. He added that if he feels he is unable to achieve this, that he will only appoint an outsider but never consider giving the opportunity to a UNPer."}
