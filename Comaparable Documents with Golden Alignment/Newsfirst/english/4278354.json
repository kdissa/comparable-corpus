Vantur, a television presenter by profession, is all set feature in a song in Atul Agnihotri directorial O Teri. It is understood that the Romanian beauty will shake a leg in one of the film’s songs and might even lend her voice to a track, alongside acclaimed singer Mika. Vantur’s presence in the film is hardly a surprise given the fact Agnihotri is Salman’s brother-in-law. The film will also have a song, wherein the superstar is set to make a cameo. Confirming the report, a source revealed to Mumbai Mirror: “Two songs are yet to be shot, one has a cameo by Salman Bhai and the other one with Lulia. Salman and Lulia will not been seen in the same song. She will be seen shaking a leg with the lead actors, Pulkit Samrat and Bilal Amrohi. The song is expected to go on floors in a city studio today and Lulia’s costumes have been designed by Ashley Rebello and Alvira Agnihotri.” Vantur was first spotted in the company of Salman last year as several reports emerged on the superstar’s closeness with her. The duo was even clicked together during the Hyderabad schedule of Jai Ho. Salman had also hinted on a possible film with Bigg Boss 7 contestant Elli Avram, a Swedish actress who made her Bollywood debut through last year’s Mickey Virus. – IBTimes India"}
