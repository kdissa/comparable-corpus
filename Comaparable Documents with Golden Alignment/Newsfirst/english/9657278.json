A group present at the public rally held in the Pothuhera market premises behaved in an unruly manner while another group that attended an SLPP rally at the Alawwa bus station had also behaved in the same way. Speaking on such behaviour, UPFA MP Shantha Bandara said that at present, there is very little space for policy-driven politics and then spoke on the public rally held in Alawwa which saw the participation of around 2500 people along with all the distinguished figures of this electorate. He went onto say that at this rally there was a group of around 20 individuals, who were drunk and that they kept shouting from the start to the end of the rally while also screaming when he took to address the crowd. “Generally, if the public hoots, we are all concerned as to whether its some form of a public protest. But in this case, it was no protest. This group was assigned to hoot at the rally. Those who are keen on entering parliament and provincial councils are responsible for this shameful act. Finally, the same thing happened to Mahinda Rajapaksa. He had to leave the event while addressing the gathering” –  he continued to say. Parliamentarian Shantha Bandara further said that every vote must be considered for this election but that there is one group that does not understand this which includes the people in the Pradeshiya Sabhas, and provincial councils who think big and who attacked the flower bud. He further urged such factions to obtain the blessings of the SLFP in the proper and respectful manner."}
