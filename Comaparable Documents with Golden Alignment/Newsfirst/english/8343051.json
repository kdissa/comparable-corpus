Sri Ranga, Leader of the JVP Anura Kumara Dissanayake commented on weapons dealings.  He noted that due to powerful politicians, the Avant Garde investigations have been suppressed to a great extent. After our senior journalist  raised a few questions,  Leader of JVP Anura Kumara Dissanayake noted that after the Attorney  General’s Department intervened, a senior official had stated that the passport of the Chairman was returned due to the intervention of the Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakse and Former Minister Tilak Marapana. He further said that weapons cannot be carried without the licence: Even if it is a home-made weapon, you will be arrested under the firearms ordinance. However,  there is a large amount of weapons under him with a trained force. He has over 4000 personnel trained by the Army. Therefore, there is a force that can commit a military coup and take over the power of this country. We are of the stance that intervention needs to be made to punish those wrong-doers. A statement had also been recorded from the former Secretary Defence"}
