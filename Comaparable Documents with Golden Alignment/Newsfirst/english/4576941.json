The former president also noted that they engaged in this business through that company and they stopped the government from earning a revenue and now they say not 430 but that they earned more than a billion rupees a month. She further alleged that Senadipathi is one who was caught for stealing in the army twice and was chased away and he was made chairman of this company. She further alleged: He is an associate of Gotabhaya. So I am not speaking mere individuals but about how people who governed this country ruined the country. It is not easy as you think to make right the situation of the country from what it was for the past decade. And you cannot come to power today and make everything right over night. Nabbing the rogues is not enough. The government must also have a program to prevent theft as well."}
