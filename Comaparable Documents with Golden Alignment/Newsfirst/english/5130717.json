The seizure of drugs was part of an operation to patrol this coastal area of Mexico that connects through to Central American nations. The crew on the boat were arrested and officials are investigating the origins of the drug haul, that not only included cocaine but other drug-making substances. Officials retrieved drugs that had been thrown out to sea, indicating crew had sought to unload as authorities closed in. The Central American corridor of nations and surrounding waters is a major trafficking route for South American cartels seeking to reach the United States."}
