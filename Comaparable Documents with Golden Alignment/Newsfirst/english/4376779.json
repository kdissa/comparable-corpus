Being put to bat first, New Zealand posted what may have been a promising total of 303 for 4 against the underdogs in their allotted 50 overs. Ross Taylor did most of the damage with his willow to remain unbeaten on 112. He was supported by Kiwi captain Kane Williamson who was unfortunately dismissed on 97. Chasing their target, the Zimbabweans started strong as Hamilton Masakadza scored 84 before being dismissed by Nathan McCullum. However it was Craig Ervine who stepped up to stun the cricketing giants as he clobbered an unbeaten 130 off 108 deliveries to guide his side to victory with one over left and 7 wickets in hand."}
