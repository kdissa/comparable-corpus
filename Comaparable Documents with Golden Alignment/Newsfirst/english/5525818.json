The request was made for Yoshitha Rajapaksa to accompany the former president to Uganda on May  11. Attorneys appearing on behalf of Yoshitha Rajapaksa on Thursday, May 5, requested court’s permission for their client to accompany former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to Uganda. The former president is said to be travelling following an invitation extended by the Ugandan Government. As the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division opposed this request, court decided to deny permission. Presenting facts to court today, the Police FCID pointed out that even though Yoshitha Rajapaksa was supposed to provide them with a statement on May 3, he had requested time until the 10th to do so. The FCID also noted that as he is supposed to provide them with a statement on May 10, they oppose the request made to travel overseas on May 11."}
