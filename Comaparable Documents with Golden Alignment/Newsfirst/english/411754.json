The people who are stranded in their pursuit of happiness spoke to us and this is what they had to say. “It will be good if we can even get a small bridge.” One of our Gammadda teams touring the country spoke with the residents of the Ampara District today. The main issue faced by the residents of the Baharella village is the lack of proper transportation facilities and road networks to enter their villages. Today our Gammadda team visited the Kitulgala, Baharella, Deraniyagala, Yatiyantota, Ambalanpitiya, Pannila Junction, Udugampola and Kalugama villages. Another Gammadda team met with the residents of Puttlam. The wild elephant conflict is the main issue that affects the residents of the Leekola- wewa, Kapupadiyawa, Mahakumbuk-Kadawala and Kalladi villages. Not only do wild elephants encroach on these villages but they destroy all of their crops adding to the mountain of issues that these people already face daily. The most recent of these wild elephant attacks was reported yesterday. The attacked claimed the life of one person. We met these people who suffer without clean drinking water in the Selwapuram village in Ampara. The sufferings of the residents in Kalugolla, Murunganeeiya, Abeyasinghepura, Lahugala, and Pothuwil is also the same. These people only ask for some clean drinking water. They are stranded and hopeless in this journey of life."}
