(August 2) He stated that a draft constitution of the new alliance was presented yesterday and steps were taken to make certain amendments to the proposals. He noted that 6 to 8 were against the new constitution. He further mentioned that UNP will unveil the new alliance at the Sugathadasa Stadium on the 5th of this month. Meanwhile, Non- Cabinet Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe states that although they were given one structure of the constitution in December 2018 and another in January that they were not given anything else that came later on. He further said that even that morning that many changes were made and they were requested to pass the constitution which they did not as it was a legal document. “The end result was to go for an election, we asked not to divide this and not to go for an election. If it is the end of the world on the 6th there won’t be an issue if we sign it on the 5th. We can discuss this matter, why the hurry? Even the MP’s from the minority parties said they are not in a hurry to sign this” added the Non-Cabinet Minister. He says that having signed it on the 5th meant there was an attempt to obstruct Sajith Premadasa being democratically proposed by the UNP, and some will say that this is already signed by the alliance, and the alliance should take the decision. He added that it is not only them but that, 90% including the minority parties are of the view that the constitution should be amended and that if not they would have to choose the candidate through an election."}
