The Jayapura wewa in the village of Jayapura in Thambalagamuwa Divisional Secretariat Division of Kantale had been renovated a year ago. It is reported that approximately 200 acres of paddy had been cultivated in the previous years. However, due to the scarcity of water, only 20 acres of paddy had been cultivated this year. The current dry weather conditions seem to be destroying the paddy cultivation completely. Additionally, dry weather conditions have affected the areas of the Hambantota district that used to be rich in water resources. It is reported that the people of Katuwana, Hidakaraldeniya, and Obadagahadeniya have been confronted with drinking waters issues due to the prevailing dry weather."}
