The session was held under the auspices of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Out of the 225 members of the Youth Parliament, 160 were elected, while 65 were appointed to represent youth organisations. Prime Minister, Ranil Wickrmesinghe stated: Discussion will take for a committee stage – a process in Parliament – and it will be implemented in January next year. The Parliament will be given an independent parliamentary budget office to inquire as to whether the documents from the Finance Ministry of the Government are in order. While we appointed around ten independent commissions. In this backdrop, establishing democracy will not be restricted to parliament and the provincial councils. We will strengthen the Youth Parliament that will accommodate the views of the youth in the country. Chairman of the National Youth Services Council, Attorney-at-Law Eranda Weliange stated: Politics means power. However, when the MPs get power , it is natural for them to change becauase people gain more pride. Because of their ignorance, they lose their power. He  added: In the UK Parliament, a baron once said that power is corruption. He again said that unlimited power means unlimited corruption. When we take a look back as the situation of the country, we could understand how corrupt politicians were when unlimited power is present. The Prime Minister appointed a committee to report on the operations of the Youth Parliament. The Committee will be headed by Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and includes State Minister Niroshan Perera and Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne."}
