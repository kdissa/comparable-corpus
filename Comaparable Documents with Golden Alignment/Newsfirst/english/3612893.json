She said several backbench MPs of the UNP are also frustrated as the party’s restructure was not done according to the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee Report. She noted that prior to the vote on the no confidence motion the Prime Minister had assured that party reforms would be conducted inline with the  Wijewardena Committee Report. MP Premachandra went on to say that close to 20 backbench MPs have decided that they will not attend anything with the Prime Minister, and the party will soon have to face an opposition within the party itself. She also commented on the overuse of committees within the UNP. MP Premachandra noted that it is time that everyone stepped up and spoke their mind as they will face difficulties the next time they have to go before the people for the election."}
