Turkish media said authorities had asked Wikipedia to remove content by writers “supporting terror”. Turkey has temporarily blocked social media sites including Facebook and Twitter in the past, usually following protests or terror attacks. Later on Saturday, Turkish authorities said they had sacked more than 3,900 civil servants, and military and police personnel as the purge of alleged anti-government officials continued, and also banned TV dating shows. The move to close down Wikipedia access is likely to further worry rights groups and Turkey’s western allies, who say Ankara has curtailed freedom of speech and other basic rights in the crackdown that followed last year’s failed coup. A block on all language editions of the online encyclopaedia was detected at 5am GMT on Saturday, monitoring group Turkey Blocks said on its website. When attempting to access the webpage using Turkish internet providers, users received a notice that the site could not be reached and a “connection timed out” error."}
