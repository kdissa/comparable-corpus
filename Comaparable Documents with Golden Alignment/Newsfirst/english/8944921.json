Mo Versi, VP of product management at HTC USA, shared this detail on Twitter stating that the Lollipop update for Desire Eye has been approved by Google. Desire Eye owners need to download a 1GB heavy Lollipop update so a Wi-Fi network is best used. The Lollipop update will bring the Sense 6.55 on board and not the new Sense 7 UI. The Material Design makeover and the new notifications settings will still be packed in this massive update though. Great news for HTC Desire Eye AT&T owners! We’ve just received technical approval for Lollipop update! OTA to start tomorrow! — Mo Versi (@moversi) June 30, 2015 Source: Gsmarena"}
