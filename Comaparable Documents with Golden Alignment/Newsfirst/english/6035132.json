Chairman of the National Movement for a Just Society Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera says that the Bribery Commissioner says that there is a mountain of files and he does not have the means to examine all of them. He notes that everything is in the same place, and going stale and this is a cause for laughter for the opposition. Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne says that if this parliament system continues in another 10 years none of us will be here and a group of mudalalis will take our seats after making a lot of money. Views were also expressed on this matter at a UNP branch committee meeting in Sedawatte, Wellampitiya. At a media briefing convened on Sunday, the JVP too criticised the failure to arrest corrupt persons. Progressive political parties also say that the people who anticipated change, are running out of patience. Accusations have also been made of mega deals or surreptitious transactions, which have delayed action being taken against corrupt persons who are at the fore in politics. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe responded to this accusation at a meeting with UNP activists, in Nuwara Eliya on Sunday morning."}
