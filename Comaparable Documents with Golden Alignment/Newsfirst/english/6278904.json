He made this statement at a forum organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on the Customs 24 X 7 initiative. Secretary of Ministry of Finance, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge said that the external trade transactions are the key source of further growth and economic progress, socio – economic progress in this country. He stated that at present trade to GDP ratio is at around 40 percent, which is not anywhere which can appreciate or be proud of. He added that the similar kind of small nations of our size may have a trade to GDP ratio in excess of 100 percent. Also speaking at the event, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake noted that the Customs 24 X 7 initiative would help speed up trans-shipment in Sri Lanka. Minister of Finance, Ravi Karunanayake said that there is  nobody that has said that this is a wrong process, except for people who lived on the system which was a failure, and thinking that they were able to make something out of that."}
