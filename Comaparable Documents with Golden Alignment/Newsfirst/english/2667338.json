Maybe it’s the parent in you or maybe, in a time when the world seems to be at its own throat, you witness a moment when everyone is on the same side. Tennis superstar Rafael Nadal stopped a match when a distraught mother interrupted the game because she had lost her young daughter in the crowd. This took place last Wednesday during an exhibition match in Nadal’s native Mallorca. Partnered with a teenager named Simon Solbas, and squaring off against Carlos Moya and John McEnroe, Nadal was on serve when a commotion in the crowd didn’t stop. And rightfully so. Nadal stopped, the crowd did too, and mother and daughter were reunited. TV footage showed the upset mother of the child standing next to a steward and shouting ‘Clara’. The spectators applauded the emotional moment and appeared to rejoice at the happy ending before the stars promptly resumed the match. The match, which was initially supposed to feature Swedish former World Number 1 Mats Wilander, 52, who had to withdraw due to an injury, ended in a victory for Nadal and Solbas."}
