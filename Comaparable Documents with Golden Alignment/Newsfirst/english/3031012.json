State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene says that no matter who engages in marches or any other act, no one can pose a challenge to this government for the next five years. ” We can recall their actions over the past few years. The people in Rathupaswala protested seeking clean drinking water. Three youth paid for it with their lives. We also took to the streets seeking the release of then General Sarath Fonseka from prison. We had to face various ruffians. Our vehicles were attacked, The police was used to fire tear gas at us. Such were the challenges that we had to face during that time” stated Minister Ruwan Wijewardena."}
