The former president further noted that he has no right to reject the request of the people, and the leaders gathered in Medamulana and that as a result, he will contest for the sake of the motherland. He also appealed to the ‘patriots’ in all political parties, including the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the United National Party (UNP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna (JVP) to join hands with him as they did back in 2005."}
