The minister noted that they have 100% state-owned power and 100% private sector but PPP (Public Private Partnerships) can be put to talk about LNG plants since one of the plants would be in for finalisation in the next six months. He added that the public interest is focussed on having high service quality, competitive pricing and for the government it is a mean of revenue. He went on to note that the tax revenue could be used in social services, education and health."}
