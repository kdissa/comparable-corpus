He said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party should unite with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. If the Sri Lanka Freedom Party does not move in that path they have envisioned on their behalf, they would have to go where the people wish them to be, he noted. “We who protected the party with tears and loved the party will have to move away from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and emerge as a new flower from the Pohottuwa Party and we will have to take this country where the people want it to go,” he continued. “We must not prepare butter cake for a presidential election, we need a cake with icing on top. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party only has the icing but the cake is with the Pohottuwa. So if we don’t put the icing on the cake then we will not have the cake or the icing.”, the Minister went on to explain. It was the result of a struggle carried out by a few of them over a long time that made President Maithripala Sirisena appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, he emphasized. He also mentioned that Mahinda Rajapaksa holds the position of the opposition leader as a result of their long struggle. He also stated the people who are appointed to high positions in their party tend to contract some sort of disease as soon as they are appointed. He further noted that there is a massive conspiracy to make the Sri Lanka Freedom Party the tail of the United National Party. There is a conspiracy within UNP to use the money that was taken out through the Central Bank bond scam to try and get some people to cross over to the UNP, the minister continued."}
