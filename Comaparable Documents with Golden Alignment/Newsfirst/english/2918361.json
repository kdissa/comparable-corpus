The band announced the performance on their website, teasing fans with a homepage message reading “April Fools?” But fans set aside any skepticism over the timing of the announcement and lined up in the hundreds outside the former Tower Records store. The lucky ones bought tickets for $10 and were given numbered wristbands beginning shortly after 10a.m. local time (1700gmt). The concert was scheduled for 11pm local (0600gmt Saturday) at the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood. The rockers, who have not performed together with their original line up for two decades, also announced a North American tour on Friday with singer Axl Rose, guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan. The members are known to have feuded for years and frontman Rose declined his invitation to be inducted with his old band mates into the Rick and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012."}
