Attorney-at-Law C. Jodhilingam stated that the TNA should make a decision on the matter regarding the new PM appointment, based on certain conditions on the will of the Tamil people. He noted that they have received information that western powers and the UN are supporting the claim of the United National Party and that if this is true a written promise must be obtained from the western countries and the UN. Jodhilingam notes that they had two good opportunities to vote; one was at the Presidential election and next, the ‘no-confidence motion’. He stated that in both these instances TNA did not present their stance firmly and that these mistakes should not be repeated. He goes on to state that Mahinda Rajapaksa is supported by China, Western Countries support Ranil Wickremesinghe. The best thing that can be done in this situation is to keep these countries as witnesses and obtain written promises from these parties. K. Krishna Menan the Chairman of the Students Association of Jaffna University stated that the decision TNA takes must be on behalf of the Tamil population."}
