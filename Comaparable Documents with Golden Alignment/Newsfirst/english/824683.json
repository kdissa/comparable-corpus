Our acts are useless to the leaders of the UNP who engage in petty politics and only think about their personal gains. Krishantha Pushpakumara further said, “One individual is attempting to become the president in 2021, while the another person is attempting to protect his position. Another group is working to protect the leadership council. One faction sides with the council while another sides with the leader. They are like railway tracks that never unite. Because of this UNP members have been left helpless and in despair.”"}
