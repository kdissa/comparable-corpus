The beedi leaves were handed over to SLNS Wasaba in Delft Island and this stock was subsequently handed over to the Customs Office-Jaffna for onward investigation. Also, the Navy found 50 kg of beedi leaves during patrols carried out by naval personnel in the seas off Kachchativu island and Northern seas, on July 31st 2019. Since the positive contribution of this nature given by the fisherfolk in favour of patrols carried out by the Navy to net the drug traffickers, they will pave the way for a drug-free society. Further, the Navy keeps a continuous vigilant eye to avert the illegal activities across and around the seas."}
