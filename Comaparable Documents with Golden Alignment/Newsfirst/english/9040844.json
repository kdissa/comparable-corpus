He noted that these tears are being shed because these countries are wondering if their agendas came to an end in Sri Lanka. He stated that the Speaker and the Prime Minister were appointed by the international community. He questioned as to why the citizens of this country are not taking to the streets if there has been an injustice? European Commission, America, Canada, Australia and especially Britain issued releases expressing their regret, said the Thero adding that Britain must be worried thinking something has gone wrong in their plan. Gunawansa Thero went onto to note that the new constitution was drafted based on foreign instructions and a group of officers were appointed with foreign intervention to create this constitution. He added that MP Sumanthiran and Jayampathi Wickremeratne typed letters without letting the officers appointed to carry out their work and embarked on a journey to please the foreign countries. However, the thero noted that the gods intervened to stop this situation."}
