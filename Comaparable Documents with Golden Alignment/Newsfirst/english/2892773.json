Earlier in the 16th of October 2016, a red warrant notice was issued by the Colombo Fort Magistrate seeking Interpol’s assistance for his arrest. This was due to the alleged involvement and financial fraud committed by Weeratunga during the purchase of several MiG aircraft for the Air Force during the reign of the former government. The website says despite the issuing of an Interpol red warrant for his arrest, Udayanga Weeratunga continues to travel the world freely."}
