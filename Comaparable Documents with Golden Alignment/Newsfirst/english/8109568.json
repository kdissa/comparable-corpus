The Meteorology Department noted that it is likely to move north-northeastwards while moving away from the island, hence the effect from this system to the island will gradually reduce. Strong winds up to 60 kmph can be expected over the island, particularly in Central hills, Northern, North-Central, North-Western and Southern provinces and in Trincomalee districts. Showers or thundershowers will occur at times over Sabaragamuwa, Central, Southern, Western and North-Western provinces. Heavy falls about 100 mm can be expected at some places in the above areas. Meanwhile, showers or thundershowers may occur at several places after 2.00 p.m. in Easter and Uva provinces and in Polonnaruwa district. The Met department requests the general public, naval and fishing communities to be attentive about future advisories issued by the Department of Meteorology."}
