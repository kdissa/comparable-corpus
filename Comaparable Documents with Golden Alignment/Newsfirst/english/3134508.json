Last year only 285 HIV cases were reported. Launched in 1988 by the world health organization and considered the first world health day, the annual observance highlights worldwide efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. World AIDS Day is also an occasion to show support for those living with HIV and to remember those who have sadly lost their lives from the infection. Globally, there are an estimated 36.7 million people who have the virus. Despite the virus only being identified in 1984, more than 35 million people have died of HIV or AIDS, making it one of the most destructive pandemics in history. This year’s theme: ‘Know your status’ intends to promote everyone to undergo medical testing to discover if the virus exists in them and to put those diagnosed positive towards the right treatment and care. Thousands of red balloons were released into the sky over Sao Paulo ahead of World AIDS Day. The balloons were released before a small crowd at the Emilio Ribas laboratory where doctors and scientists are working to combat the virus. A rally was organized by the Ministry of Health in Sri Lanka in line with the World’s AIDS day. The event was held under the auspices of Director General of Health Services Anil Jasinghe. The rally which commenced at the Colombo Municipal Council premises reached the BMICH in Colombo. Officials of the Civil organizations and the Health Ministry attended the event."}
