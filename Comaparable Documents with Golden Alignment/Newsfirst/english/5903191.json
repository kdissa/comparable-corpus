According to a police report filed in São Paulo, the woman alleges that the attack took place in a hotel in the French capital, where Neymar plays for Paris St-Germain (PSG). Neymar sought to prove his innocence by posting what he says is an exchange of Whatsapp messages between the pair. He is now in Brazil training with the national team for the Copa América. According to police documents, the woman – who has not been named – got to know Neymar on Instagram and he suggested they meet in Paris. He provided her with an air ticket from Brazil to France and a reservation at a luxury hotel in Paris. When Neymar came to the hotel on 15 May, he was “apparently drunk”, the woman alleges. After conversation and embraces, “at some point, Neymar became aggressive, and through violence, engaged in sexual intercourse against the will of the victim”, the police document states. The woman returned to Brazil two days later, without reporting the alleged incident to French police, because she was “emotionally shaken and afraid to register the facts in another country”, the document continues.
