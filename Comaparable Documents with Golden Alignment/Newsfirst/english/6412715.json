Ms Sobol was in a taxi about to set off for the rally when police officers dragged her into a black van, which swiftly sped off. Protesters are gathering in the Russian capital after authorities disqualified a number of opposition candidates from standing in local elections. Media reports suggest 33 people have been arrested across Moscow. Officers in riot gear have moved into the capital and warned people not to protest. Ms Sobol, a lawyer, and video blogger is one of the candidates excluded from the local elections. She has been on hunger strike for 21 days and called on others to join the unsanctioned protest on Saturday.  Authorities said she is being held for violating regulations for street demonstrations. In July, Ms Sobol was dragged out of the electoral commission office on a sofa. Speaking to independent broadcaster Dozhd before her detention, she said the authorities “are doing everything they can to try to intimidate the opposition”. “That is why it is important to come out today to show that Muscovites are not afraid of provocation and they are ready to continue to stand up for their rights,” she added.
