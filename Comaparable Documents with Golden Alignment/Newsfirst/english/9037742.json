Rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young has been sidelined due to serious health issues, frontman Brian Johnson has temporarily stepped aside due to hearing loss and may return, drummer Phil Rudd got into some legal trouble for a little bit, and the band’s bassist recently said he’d back down from touring and recording post-tour. So it almost comes as no surprise that in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, guitarist Angus Young said he’s not too sure what the future holds for the band. That was always the idea, especially when we were younger – me, Malcolm, Bon. You had to show up and be on time. You’d be playing in a pub in the afternoon. Then late at night, you’d be playing a club. You got into that habit: ‘If we don’t play, we don’t eat.’” For a band that put out its first album in 1975 and has had such monstrous hits as AC/DC, calling it quits now is extremely respectable, if not entirely sensical given the lineup it currently has."}
