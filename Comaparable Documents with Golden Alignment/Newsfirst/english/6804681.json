However, the US and Russia said the missile had a medium range and presented no threat to either country. The launch comes days before leaders from the Group of 20 nations are due to discuss steps to rein in Pyongyang’s weapons programmes, which the North has pursued in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions."}
