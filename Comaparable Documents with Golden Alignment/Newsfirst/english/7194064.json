The meeting was held at the Uva Provincial Council Hall on Tuesday morning. Speaking at the meeting the Provincial Councillor noted that he came across a poem recently on facebook, adding that the poem was about unemployed graduates. He added that it is not the value of the rupee that has slumped in the country, but the value of degrees. Speaking further the Provincial Councillor made the following remarks: ”If you consider the situation of the country at present, it is not the rupee that has slumped it is the political system. Livelihoods have deteriorated more than the political system. Degrees have collapsed more than the lives. We live in such a country at present.”"}
