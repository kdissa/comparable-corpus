During his visit to Norway, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will meet the Prime Minister of Norway Erna Solberg, as well as the Foreign minister. Following his visit to Norway, the PM is scheduled to meet Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May in London. Joining the prime minister on his tour will be Minister of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, MP’s Kavinda Jayawardena and Hesha Vithanage. In the recent past, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Harsha De Silva stated that trips to foreign countries should be minimized at this time to uplift the country from its economic situation and on this policy he had even canceled a foreign trip. However, while the UNP MP Harsha de Silva preaches of tightening belts it seems as if his leader and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe prefers to loosen them. Why is there a contradiction between the statements made by the ministers and state ministers and the actions of the government? Does the Government practice what they preach?"}
