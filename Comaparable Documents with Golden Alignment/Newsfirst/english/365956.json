A senior lecturer, Thusitha Mendis and a group of the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Management of Rajarata University conducted the excavation. The burial grounds were discovered in a forest area in Kokebe, Kahatagasdigiliya. Extensive excavations had been carried out on three selected burial pits and a number of pre historic facts pertaining to the Megalithic era have been discovered. Dr. Mendis added that 215 burial stones belonging to four different varieties were unearthed through the excavations. “Clay objects which are maroon in color, glass beads and other forms of beads were found. We found more than 90 blue and green color beads in these pits. With this discovery it is clear that the people of central valley knew how to create beads by 800 BC”, said Dr. Mendis. He also mentioned that these burial sites are the oldest megalithic burial sites discovered so far, as it was deduced that these burial grounds were 2800 years old after the samples were produced for carbon dating. He went on to note that, it is clear that a civilization with high traditional and cultural backgrounds lived in Anuradhapura and that this situation proves that the Sri Lankan identity is one that goes beyond the story of king Vijaya."}
