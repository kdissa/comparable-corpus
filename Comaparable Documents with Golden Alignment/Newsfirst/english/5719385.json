Both Catholic priests and devotees attended the event. Venerable Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangarakkitha Thero addressed the crowd present at the event. The Thero noted that terrorism only brings devastation and futility to all of mankind. According to the Thero, it was important to verify the sanity of these terrorists who take lives to appease their god. The Thero advised the misguided terrorists to open their minds and refer to other philosophies that exist in the world and learn that committing murder would not take anyone to heaven in order to be rewarded."}
