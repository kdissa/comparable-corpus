According to data from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation there are 543 families living obstructing the major canals in Colombo. The data notes that 2327 families are living in a manner obstructing the secondary canals in Kotte, Gothatuwa and Bloemendhal. The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation says that 5600 families are living illegally while obstructing various canals that start from Avissawella and end in the Kelani River within the Western Province. In addition, 296 unauthorized land fills have taken place during the past year in catchment areas. 190 such incidents were reported from January to April this year. Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Patali Champika Ranawaka stated that they are going to end the disorderly urbanization of the country by taking over canals and low lands. The Dehiwala, Ratmalana and Kesbewa areas which are prone to floods for the slightest rains, were not affected this time around. The Minister attributed this to the Weras River Project. Under this project, old canals were expanded for the management of flood waters. Under another project launched as part of the Weras River Project, new locations were designed for the collection of rain water and water from culverts while new locations were also designed for the storage of water using bare land."}
