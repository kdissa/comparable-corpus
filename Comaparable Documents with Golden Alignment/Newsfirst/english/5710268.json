The order was issued following a request made by the Attorney General on behalf of the Criminal Investigation Department. Accordingly, the extension will be valid for 30 days and is renewable. Issuing a communique, the Presidentâ€™s Media Division stated that these measures are aimed at ensuring that Perpetual Treasuries Limited or other parties acting in concert with it, do not transfer money derived out of transactions involving illegally acquired Treasury Bonds. The communique further notes that the decision will increase the confidence of the initiative to bring the perpetrators of the financial crime related to the Bond Scam before law and recover the losses to the country."}
