The residents claim that individuals who do not reside on Donald Obeysekera Mawatha are now dumping their garbage in the area. Voice of the residents: “Every day garbage is dumped here. After that a tractor comes here and they load the garbage. Mosquitoes are breeding here. People should be more considerate”. “There is no point in talking about this. We must tell this to those who are dumping garbage. Nothing gets done just because we talk about it”. “Nobody understands that it is the environment that is being polluted. This is a nuisance for those living in this neighborhood. Nothing gets done. There is no point talking about it”.
