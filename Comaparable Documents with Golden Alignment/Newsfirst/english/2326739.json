He continued to say that in the country, the ruling party always had 90% of the rogues. People who commit crimes of a smaller nature cannot even get bail in 2-3 weeks time. But for the people who robbed the CBSL there is freedom. MP Rajapaksa said that even when Mahendran was at BOC, he was well known for corruption and that he (Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa), Rajitha Senaratne and Patali Champika Ranawaka had opposed his recruitment when the cabinet paper was presented by the Prime Minister. He continued to say that even amidst strong objections that the Prime Minister had stressed that the appointment of Arjuna Mahendran as governor of the CBSL was absolutely necessary. Even the President had granted approval after much hesitation since the Prime Minister had pleaded with him to make the decision. MP Rajapaksa also said that on the morning of the day that the bond scam was unveiled that he had visited the Prime Minister with documents stating the humungous size of the scam and asked for advice on future proceedings. He added that the Prime Minister had simply taken the files and left without an answer."}
