According to a report by The Times of India, the ISIS has appointed Abu Muhammed al-Bengali as the new ’emir’ (chief) in Bangladesh. An ISIS poster said “If you think you have silenced the soldiers of the Khilafa in Bengal and Hind and you are certain about that then listen: We men are never to be silenced. And our thirst for revenge has not faded away ” The new security threat comes a day after the ISIS carried out a minor explosion near a cinema hall theatre in Dhaka. The explosion did not result in any casualties but a few policemen sustained injuries in the blast."}
