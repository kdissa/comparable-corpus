Wang Mingqing’s tireless search included becoming a taxi driver in Chengdu city, in the hope he might one day pick her up as a passenger. His daughter made contact with him earlier this year after coming across an online post about him. The family met in a tearful reunion today (April 3), where Wang hugged his daughter and said: “Daddy loves you.” The incredible story has swept China, where many are celebrating the reunion. Wang’s daughter Qifeng disappeared when she was just three years old, according to interviews he gave to Chinese media outlets. He and his wife Liu Dengying were fruit sellers, and one day after they finished serving customers at their roadside stall, they realised Qifeng was no longer by their side. They have spent years searching for her in the city and surrounding areas, taking out advertisements in newspapers and setting up online appeals. The couple, who have another daughter, never left Chengdu, in the hopes that Qifeng would find her way back to them. In 2015, Wang has decided to broaden the search by signing up as a driver with ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing. He put up a large sign appealing for information on his rear window, and also gave out cards with information about Qifeng to every passenger he ferried. Wang did not have a picture of Qifeng as a toddler so he used a picture of his other daughter in his leaflets, as they looked similar. His unique method gained attention from the Chinese media. “One day, my daughter may just be the person sitting in my car!” he was quoted as saying."}
