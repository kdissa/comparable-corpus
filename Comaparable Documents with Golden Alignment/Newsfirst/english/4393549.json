According to the Director of the National STD Eradication Unit Dr. Sisira Liyanage, there are currently 2,014 persons infected with HIV in Sri Lanka. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus also known as HIV has infected more 39 million people across the globe. More than 35 million people have died from the virus, making it one of the most destructive pandemics in history. Sub Saharan Africa is the most affected region, with 24.7 million people living with HIV in 2013 and accounts for almost 70% of the global total of new HIV infections. This year the WHO aims to “close the gap in HIV Prevention and Treatment” – they believe that they will be able to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Through this initiative the 19 million people who are unaware of their HIV-positive status can begin to get support and all 35 million people living with HIV will have access to life-saving medicine."}
