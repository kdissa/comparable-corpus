The SLFP heavyweight made clear he was distancing himself from Gammanpila’s statements imploring his audience to “not be fooled by the attempts of Gammanpila, and the contract he has undertaken on behalf of the United National Party.” He said the SLFP were not after posts but were committed to the well-being of their party members However, he maintained that “If the party decides tomorrow that it will defect from the government, we will happily do it.” Praising President Maithripala Sirisena, the senior SLFP leader said ” Maithripala Sirisena has a sound knowledge of the current political trend. Therefore, we are certain that the he will not allow this party to break up, because he has not done anything which would lead up to it.”"}
