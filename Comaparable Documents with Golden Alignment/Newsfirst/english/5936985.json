Scuffles broke out between leftist militant protesters and police in Hamburg on Saturday (April 30). The demonstration of about 2,000 people according to the organisers, many of them ready for violence, was widely peaceful although noisy. According to eye-witnesses, some 800 protesters later threw bottles and stones at the police. A heavy police presence gave the march a dangerous atmosphere, with onlookers being heard chanting for the police to go away. Several people have been detained after the police halted the demonstration in a bid to stop people throwing bottles."}
