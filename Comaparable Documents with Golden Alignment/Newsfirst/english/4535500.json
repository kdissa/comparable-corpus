Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy explained that fiscal consolidation is something the nation has to do despite the existence of the IMF. He added that even though the money given by the IMF is not a lot, the certification (‘the good house keeping seal’) from the IMF allows the catalysation of money which in turn reduces the pain of adjustment The governor also spoke of the benchmark Sri Lanka should achieve, noting that it is upsetting that the country keeps bench-marking itself with South Asia, because there was a time when Sri Lanka was only second to Japan in just about any indicator in Asia. He added that Sri Lanka needs to benchmark itself against countries such as Malaysia or Thailand and not South Asia."}
