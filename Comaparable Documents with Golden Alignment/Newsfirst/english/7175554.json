It was on January 19,  2015 that information came to light with regard to the floating armoury discovered in the Galle Harbor. Convener of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe expresses the following views, ”We have received information on another privately-owned warehouse used to store arms belonging to the Defence Unit located in Ratmalana. There are two ships which have been used to store these weapons. However, a question has arisen as to how many arms are currently stored in these warehouses. But the Minister of defence as usual is very slow to take action against this.” Wasantha Samarasinghe added that because this was handed over to a private organisation army veterans have not been paid a proper salary. Meanwhile a group of individuals who had been employed by Avant Garde and are now working as maritime security personnel engaged in a protest opposite the JVP office in Battramulla. Convener of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe noted that this situation has come under scrutiny to not create conflict but rather to ensure the security of this country."}
