James, 33, signed a four-year, $154 million contract with Lakers over the summer, making the famed franchise the third stop of his NBA career after stints with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat. The Los Angeles Lakers, winners of 11 NBA titles, finished last season in third place in the Pacific division with a record of 35-47 and missed the playoffs for the fifth straight year. James and the Lakers will open the NBA regular season October 18 at the Portland Trail Blazers before playing their first home game on October 20 against the Houston Rockets."}
