Indian paceman Ishant Sharma exchanged a few words with Dhammika Prasad and Dinesh Chandimal and on Sunday the gangling bowler argued with Rangana Herath and Kusal Perera. Ishant has bowled with heart and so far collected seven wickets, including five in the first innings. Sri Lanka are tottering at 67/3 in a record chase of 386 and if India can pull off a series win, a lot of credit will go to Ishant, but only just. Gavaskar feels Ishant’s run-ins with Lankan players will tarnish his good spells. Ishant has clearly not learnt from his mistakes. In the second Test at the P. Sara Oval, which India won to draw level in the series, the Delhi seamer was fined 65 per cent of his match fees after an unruly celebration. “Ishant showing passion is very good, but he must control himself because he is the leading bowler,” Gavaskar told NDTV from Colombo on Monday. “Some of the scenes (at the SSC) were not what you wanted to see. International players need to remember they are role-model. This is just a sport that should be played (in the right spirit). A lot of young players are watching.”"}
