While the ban came into effect on Thursday morning, the interim injunction order was issued in the afternoon. The Court of Appeal issued the interim injunction today, after considering two public interest petitions filed by two civilians. Lawyers representing the petitioners submitted to court that using full face helmets gives added safety to motorcyclists. They point out that the ban that has been enforced via a police circular issued in March in line with the gazette notice issued in 1991 pertaining to the headgear of motorcyclists, is illegal and unjust. The ban on full face helmets was enforced this morning. The Police noted that rather than strictly enforcing the law from the outset, they would implement the rule in stages. Accordingly, while motorcyclists were stopped and advised, no fine or punishment was imposed. Police claim that the ban was enforced, due to the spreading virus of theft carried out by thieves wearing full face helmets and the rise in accidents due to reduced visibility. National Committee Member of Voice of the Youth, Asitha Niroshan expressed these views: Professor Dickman Otte of Hanoi University in Germany conducted a study in 2010 along with other experts. The full-face helmet was designed on a scientific basis. They have marked the damage that occurs when motorcyclists meet with accidents. 19.7 percent of the damage is on the base of the neck. Almost 35 percent is to the face. Just because a bank was robbed or a finance company was robbed, they cannot make such cheap arguments to ban something that has been designed by scientists to ensure the safety of motorcyclists."}
