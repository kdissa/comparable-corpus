The main aim of this programme is to encourage and empower women who who play a major role in developing the economy, and in ensuring the greater well-being of society. The campaign which will travel across the country which signifies the safety and equality of the women, is an initiative of News1st, Sirasa, Shakthi and the Sri Lanka Police. The programme provided an opportunity to express views on the difficulties they face and their proposals to overcome them. The awareness programme went from door to door appreciating the role of women who sacrifice and balances everything in life, despite the difficulties they face. Women of  a majority of houses are in abroad, contributing their fullest effort to earn for the survival of their families. Meanwhile, another awareness programme on Women empowerment was carried out in Jaffna. The programme took place at the Rajeshwari Hall in Jaffna, and women who participated in  the event were given an opportunity to share their problems. The awareness programme carried out in Jaffna was able to attract many residents who joined in the endeavour with much enthusiasm. News1st’s  determination saw many lives change, with this endeavour, bringing in strength, solace, unity and the will to forge ahead."}
