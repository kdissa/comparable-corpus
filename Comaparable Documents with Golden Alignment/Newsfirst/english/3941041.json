The swearing in took place at a ceremony at the Oval Office. The Texas native, 64, was cleared for full Senate approval in a 56-43 vote. The vote came after Senate Republicans changed the rules in order to approve Trump’s nominees for health and treasury, despite a democratic boycott. Tillerson has never held political office. As Tillerson was sworn by the Vice-President, the US President said, “Your whole life has prepared you for this moment”. In response, the new top diplomat thanked the President and said, “As I serve this President, I will always represent the interests of the American people at all times”. As Secretary of State, Tillerson will handle relations with countries including China and Russia and negotiate matters such as climate change and human rights, on behalf of Trump. Rex Tillerson is said to have good connections with Russia as a result of oil and gas dealings, throughout his life at Exxon Mobil."}
