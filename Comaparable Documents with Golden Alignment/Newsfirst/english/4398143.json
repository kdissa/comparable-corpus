Our reporters say that following reports that the President would be visiting Trincomalee, people in the area have become very hopeful. From among the various problems being faced by people living in the 230 Grama Niladhari Divisions in the eleven administrative divisions in the Trincomalee District, problems pertaining to fisheries, infrastructure and land, take prominence. Their hope is that with these problems being addressed, an environment will arise where they can live in freedom. President Maithripala Sirisena is to declare open new facilities at the Eastern University in Trincomalee on Tuesday."}
