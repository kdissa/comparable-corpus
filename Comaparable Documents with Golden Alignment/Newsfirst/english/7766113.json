He explained that a framework has been created for a new Counter Terrorism Act while establishing a committee chaired by the prime minister where the three-armed forces, the police, the Attorney General’s Department and the intellectuals were also involved and that around 30 meetings took place and matters were discussed and debated. He added that the president was also informed of this, and with his approval the draft was presented to the Cabinet and this will be made public through monitoring committees for discussion When questioned on the timeline of approving and enforcing the amended act, the minister replied stating that hopefully the process will be completed through the monitoring committee within a month after obtaining cabinet approval. “We will not be able to do this before the budget. We hope to take this up as the first draft bill in parliament next year”, explained Minister Ratnayake."}
