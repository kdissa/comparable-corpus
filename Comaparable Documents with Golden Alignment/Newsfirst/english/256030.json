[quote]Everyone is saying that the theives have not been caught and not enough has been done. There was a quick system of nabbing the thieves and fraudsters. Such a system existed in the past. During the previous regime, when allegations were leveled at the government either from the trade unions, the media or any other sector, a white van was sent and people were either taken away or murdered or chased from the country. Such a system cannot exist anymore as it is not part of a just and legal system. It operates only within thuggery. Therefore, thuggery has been put an end to and good governance has been created.
