The Head of Medans Immigrant Detention House said that the detainees are considered to have violated immigration law, with some seeking asylum to countries such as Australia. Indonesian authorities say the immigrants entered Indonesia in wooden boats. Medan has in recent times become a transit point for immigrants before they continue their voyage to Australia to seek asylum."}
