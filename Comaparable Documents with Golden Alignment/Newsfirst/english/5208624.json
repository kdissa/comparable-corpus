FDI’s play a key role in improving the Sri Lankan economy. So who is hampering investments coming into the country? The leader of the National Unity Alliance, Azath Salley believes that the actions of certain ministers have resulted in investors turning away from the country. Addressing a media briefing on Tuesday (Oct 2), Salley noted that Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama had given an assurance to everyone who cut deals during former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s tenure, they would be looked after. He states that investors who came to the country during the Rajapaksa tenure turned away because certain individuals asked for 40% stakes in these companies. A similar situation is present today as well according to the leader of the National Unity Alliance who accused the Chairman of the UNP, Minister Malik Samarawickrama of playing this role."}
