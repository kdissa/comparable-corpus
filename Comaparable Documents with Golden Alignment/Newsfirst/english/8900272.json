The Bureau’s Deputy General Manager Mangala Randeniya said that the expatriates have been educated on health safety measures to prevent the virus from spreading. South Korean President Park Geun-hye convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday and said everything must be done to stop Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) as fear of the disease shut hundreds of schools. Five more cases were confirmed on Wednesday taking  the number infected in South Korea to thirty, since the outbreak began there two weeks ago. Two people have died, fuelling fear in the country with the most cases outside the Middle East, where the disease first appeared. The Education Ministry said that more than 200 schools were shut on Wednesday, most of them in the province of Gyeonggi, around Seoul, where the first death occurred on Monday."}
