A species of a caterpillar is spreading fast in the North Western Province, damaging crops and ruining harvests. Experts believe this caterpillar is similar to the Fall Army Worm, that devastated crops in many parts of Sri Lanka a few months ago. The farmers claim that hundreds of acres of land have been damaged so far. The pests have reportedly fed on the paddy stem and leaf and have spread rapidly over past two weeks. According to our News 1st correspondent, the caterpillars have even begun feeding on grass, which will impact livestock.
