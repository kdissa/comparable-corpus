The official website of the aviation company allegedly owned by MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena lists cargo transport between India and Sri Lanka as being among the services it provides. The pictures and information on this website reveal that the plane in question is a Boeing 727. While the plane is not in production anymore, a 727 which is in flying condition typically costs over two million US dollars. The website of the aviation company purported to be owned by Sajin de Vass Gunawardena states that it carries out cargo transport services in countries in the SAARC region jointly with Sri Lankan Airlines. However, the 727 which has Lankan Cargo emblazoned on it, has been parked in front of the section of the cargo terminal at the BIA which is used by Sri Lankan Airlines. The plane was seen parked at the BIA, on the evening of Monday March 2. According to airport authorities, a sum of 4000 dollars must be paid each month, to park such an aircraft at this location. How did the aviation company purportedly owned by Sajin de Vass Gunawardena come to be in possession of this 727? Who is the actual owner of the aeroplane? The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption has recorded a statement from MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena. The Commission noted that the statement was recorded after considering a complaint that had been lodged adding that investigations into the matter have commenced."}
