The order has been issued by the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court citing that the two should appear on a day between May 18 and 23. Mount Lavinia Magistrate Mohamed Sahabdeen issued this order after taking into consideration a motion filed by the attorneys appearing on behalf of Yoshitha Rajapaksa and his grandmother, requesting for a separate date to appear in court. The magistrate had previously ordered the two individuals to appear before the FCID on a day between April 4 and 9.. The reason for the summon, is to record a statement on the lands surrounding a house under construction, which is said to belong to former first lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa. The land is said to be purchased under the name of the 88-year old grandmother, through the intervention of Yoshitha Rajapaksa. Furthermore, the contractor who has been tasked with the house construction is also among those summoned by the magistrate to appear before courts. Police investigations so far have revealed that the plots of land in question located around the house in Mihindu Mawatha, Mount Lavinia were purchased for a sum of Rs. 50 million through the intervention of Yoshitha Rajapaksa, under the name of his grandmother. Police reported to court that the owners of the land had said that Yoshitha Rajapaksa had co-ordinated the transaction."}
