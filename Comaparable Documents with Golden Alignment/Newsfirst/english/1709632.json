After tying a piece of string around his eight-year-old son’s front tooth and instructing him to keep his head up, Rob Venomous then hops into the driving seat of his 426 horsepower sports car and hits the accelerator. As the revving of the powerful engine shatters the quiet of the residential street, the tooth is yanked free leaving the boy grinning at the camera as his mother captures the whole stunt on video. The petrol-head father then uploaded the footage to YouTube with the strapline “tooth pulling never sounded so good”."}
