Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera is to address the UN Human Rights Council against a backdrop where the publication of the OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka or OISL report, which was due this month, was postponed by six months The UN Human Right Council Session which commences on Monday with a participation of 65 countries will conclude on March 27. The OISL Report was to be tabled this March. However on February 17  the UN High Commissioner for Human rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein recommended that it be postponed by six months. Explaining his “difficult decision,” Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a press release issued by his office that the deferral of the report was “for one time only,” and guaranteed that the report would be published by September. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that there should be no misunderstanding and that he gives his personal, absolute and unshakable commitment that the report will be published by September. The US-sponsored resolution on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council in March last year, mandated the OHCHR to conduct an investigation on alleged war crimes committed during the conflict in Sri Lanka, and to submit a report to the council. Twenty three (23) nations voted in favour of the resolution while 12 voted against, with 12 abstaining."}
