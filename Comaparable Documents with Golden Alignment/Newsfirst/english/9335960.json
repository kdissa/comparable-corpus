The project was implemented by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) under the direction of the Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera. SLTDA has developed the basic curriculum for a two-day training course and test, after which the driver would receive a certification of completion, stickers and a photo identification card that must be displayed in the tuk-tuk. The certified tuk-tuk drives can display the seal on their three-wheeler allowing local and foreign tourists to easily identified the trained drivers and obtain their services. Training and educating three-wheeler drivers will no doubt help increase their individual incomes and the local economy of the community while providing safer and more organized travel choices for tourists."}
