The annual ceremony took place at the Polonnaruwa Gal Viharaya seeking rains at the appropriate time, and for the agriculture industry to flourish. The President bathed the feet of the Buddha Statue at the Temple, seeking rains at the appropriate time for the cultivations. The President noted that with the prevalent inclement weather, there is a need to conserve water existing in the reservoirs – and ensure that cultivation is done during the Yala harvesting season. He pointed out that even though the water mass in Sri Lanka is ten times the land mass, due to shortcoming and weaknesses in water management, large amounts of water is lost and everyone must take responsibility for it. He added that some special projects during the coming period, in this regard, are being prepared and also, work is being done towards providing organic fertiliser and expertise in this regard."}
