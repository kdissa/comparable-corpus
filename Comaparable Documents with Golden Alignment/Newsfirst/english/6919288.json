The two members who did not sign the report, were given time until January9 to do so. Chairman of the Committee Ashoka Peiris said that SLFP representative Saliya Mathew signed the final report today. Attorney-at-Law Misbah Sathar who represents the United National Party is yet to sign the report. Executive Director of CaFFE, Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon added that the UNP Representative is yet to sign the Delimitation Appeals Committee report. And with the recent development it is clear that the United National Party wants to postpone the local government elections or they want to have the elections under the proportional system. “They are engaged in an act of sabotage”, charged Tennakon who explained that through the delay in signing the Delimitation Appeals Committee report, it is clear that the United National Party wants to postpone the elections."}
