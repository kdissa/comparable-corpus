The Bribery Commission filed indictments against Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd Chairman Retired Major Nissanka Senadhipathi and Major General Palitha Fernando for allegedly offering and accepting a bribe of Rs. 35.5 million in order to facilitate the operation of a floating armoury. When the case was taken up today, President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana appearing for the defendants informed the court that Nissanka Senadhipathi – the second accused – is in Singapore for Medical Treatment and Palitha Fernando – the first accused – is in remand custody over a separate case. However, the High Court Judge issued the order for their arrests as necessary documentation to prove the counsel’s claims were not produced in court. Notice was issued on the bondsman for the two accused to be present in court on August 7th."}
