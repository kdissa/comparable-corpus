With the transfer fee reportedly in the region of Â£20m, the completion of the deal is seemingly cemented with Gundogan becoming the first acquisition for new City manager Pep Guardiola. Gundogan will miss Euro 2016 and the start of the new Premier League season after suffering a dislocated kneecap in training at the start of May but City has high hopes that the German midfielder will play crucial role under the new manager. Gundogan was also sidelined for the 2014 World Cup with a back problem that ruled him out for almost the entire 2013-14 season. Gundogan joined Dortmund from Nuremberg in 2011 and was a evident factor in the sides run to the 2013 Champions League final before signing a new contract in 2015 that still has a year."}
