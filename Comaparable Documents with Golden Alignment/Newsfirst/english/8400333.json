The new indictment, released by the Department of Justice in Washington, comes hours after the arrest of two Fifa vice-presidents in Zurich. Former Brazil football federation chief Ricardo Teixeira was among those accused of being “involved in criminal schemes involving well over $200m (£132m) in bribes and kickbacks”. Current Brazil football president Marco Polo del Nero is also on the new “superseding” 92-count indictment, which alleges “racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies” with “sustained abuse of positions for financial gain”. US attorney general said that the betrayal of trust set forth here is outrageous. The scale of corruption alleged herein is unconscionable. Earlier, Hawit and Napout were held in a dawn raid at the Baur au Lac hotel, Zurich, arrested on suspicion of accepting millions of dollars of bribes, at the request of the US authorities. The US is attempting to extradite them. The Swiss hotel is the same location where several Fifa officials were arrested in May. Fifa’s executive committee has been meeting in the city, voting on reforms."}
