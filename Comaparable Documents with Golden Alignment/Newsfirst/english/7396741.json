Minister Samaraweera is due to address the UN Human Rights Council against a backdrop where the publication of the OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka or OISL report, which was due this month, has been postponed by six months. The postponement of the publication was decided on, following a recommendation made by the High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al-Hussein. This recommendation was prompted by a letter from the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, in which he outlined the government’s 100 day plan for reform and pledged greater accountability. News1st exclusively reported on the content of this letter which was purportedly sent by the Foreign Minister to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Minister Samaraweera will speak during the high level segment of the 28th session of the Human Rights Council, on Monday."}
