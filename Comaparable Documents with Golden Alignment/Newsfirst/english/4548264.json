A. Sumanthiran expressed his views on the current political status of the country. He said that there is an attempt to split the party and that there is a person who has already crossed over and taken up a ministerial position. Sumanthiran openly questioned the president if people had brought him to power to create divisions among the people adding that he is a cunning person. In response to these remarks, General Secretary of the UNFF Maithri Gunaratne said that MP Sumanthiran had addressed the President in a very indecent manner and that he has completely forgotten about the thousands of acres of land released to the people in the North because of the president. Gunarathne continued to say that it is only because of this government that MP Sumanthiran has the freedom to talk about the President in this manner. Maithri Gunaratne added that these remarks clearly shows a deal between Ranil Wickremesinghe and MP Sumanthiran."}
