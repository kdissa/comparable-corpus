Speaking to News 1st, district secretary of Anurdapura D. P. G. Kumarasiri said that the poson committee has paid attention to providing basic facilities required by the visitors, including water, electricity and toilet facilities. “Accordingly, with the support of the private sector, we have set up mobile toilets. at the same time special bus and train services are also in operation for the convenience of visitors. We request from all visitors to be conscious of the sacred grounds and minimize environmental pollution,” he said. He added: “Since the water levels in tanks are high at this point we have placed lifeguards at these locations. and it is important that visitors bathe where there are lifeguards. The municipal council is also focusing on disposing garbage at proper locations.”"}
