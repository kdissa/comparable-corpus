Speaking at the event the minister stated that no matter what electoral system is in place, it will not be an issue to serve the people. He further added that some are attempting to move up the ladder through the preferential system while others are trying to destroy fellow candidate through cruel acts under this preferential votes system. He went on to add that some will use the preferential system to do double-standard politics by destroying all wealth and reputation of others but may it be preferential politics or district politics, or whatever system it may be, he is up for the electorate system and the district system."}
