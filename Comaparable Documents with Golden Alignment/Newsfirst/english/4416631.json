He continued to say that simply the President should accept the majority in parliament adding that neither MR nor Ranil has a right to appear as the Prime Minister now. Tilvin Silva said that thereby the President is responsible for appointing a new Prime Minister and abide by the majority of parliament. He further added that since it is difficult to run a government based on the majority of parliament that they should go for an election and that they have no objection in doing so once the country is stabilized."}
