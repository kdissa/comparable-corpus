The President adds that heads of state from the ancient past strived to create a just society for all by taking a leaf from the Dhamma and today steps have been taken to build a disciplined country. President Sirisena further stated that the current state policy is to eschew all misdeeds and build a society where everyone can live as respectable citizens on the basis of the Buddhist theme. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his message for Poson Poya Day, says that in today’s world this noble teaching based on compassion and non-violence has been challenged, due to the extremist, short-sighted and violent acts and that this is regretful. The Prime Minister adds that it is our responsibility to change this situation and enrich our lives spiritually, not materially and live with co-existence, respecting other religions and cultures."}
