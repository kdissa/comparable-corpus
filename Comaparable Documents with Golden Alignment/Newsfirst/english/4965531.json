New Democratic Front – Presidential Candidate, Maithripala Sirisena said: [quote] There is massive anti-government sentiment that is taking centre-stage. Based on the survey reports that we receive, our victory is at a very high level. Mahinda Rajapaksa is in a state of confusion. You might have witnessed recently when the President spoke he was speaking in rage. I always say, My dear Mahinda Rajapaksa do not get angry. Do not have any hatred. Do not suffer. There is a massive anti-government sentiment that is arising against you. You must understand this. Bow down to the people’s power. Be kind to the people. Be loving to them. You must understand democracy. It cannot be subdued by the power of money or weapons or even state power. You defeat is definite. We will record a resounding victory. [/quote]"}
