Saipov told investigators he was inspired by Islamic State videos, in particular one showing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and began planning an attack a year ago, a federal criminal complaint states. Saipov decided to conduct a truck attack “to inflict maximum damage against civilians” and that he specifically chose to strike on Halloween “because he believed there would be more civilians on the street for the holiday,” the complaint says. Six people died at the scene and two more in hospital. Twelve people were injured, nine of whom remain in hospital."}
