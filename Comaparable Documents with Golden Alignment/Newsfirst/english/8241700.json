The protest organised by the National Trade Union Centre against the eastern terminal of the Colombo Port being leased out, commenced opposite the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Police stopped the protesters, with a court order in hand, from moving towards the Presidential Secretariat via Lotus Road in Colombo. But the protesters broke through the barricades that were placed. Police used tear gas and water cannons. “What did the government, that is selling the property of the people of the country, show us? They showed us that what is remaining is not democracy but tear gas”, charged JVP Parliamentarian,, Sunil Handunnetti He added that the government needs to be reminded that the people they controlled through tear gas are the same people who removed rulers from their thrones. “The people have not appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe or Malik Samarawickrema through public mandate to sell the port…” said the JVP."}
