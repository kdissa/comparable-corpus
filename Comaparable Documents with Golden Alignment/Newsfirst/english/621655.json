That’s according to new data from IDC, which ranks Fitbit top of the tree with 3.9 million shipments in Q1 2015, that’s more than double its previous year and 34.2 percent of the current market. Xiaomi came in next with 2.8 million shipments — 24.6 of the market — ahead of Garmin (6.1 percent), Samsung (5.1 percent) and Jawbone (4.4 percent).
