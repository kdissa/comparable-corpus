From the brave reporting of the Watergate scandal which led to the resignation of a US President, to more recent revelations which have shaken governments, the fourth estate has served to hold to account to society, their rulers and their wrongs. Globally, the free media plays a major role in providing a platform for investigative journalists, and serves to protect them while delivering their message to the people. Veteran Diplomat, Dr. Jayantha Dhanapala expressed his views on free media in Sri Lanka. Please watch video. In Sri Lanka, investigative journalists have attracted the ire of those who would seek to abuse their powers on countless occasions. From threats to assassinations, this open flouting of democratic principles has caused many to go into exile."}
