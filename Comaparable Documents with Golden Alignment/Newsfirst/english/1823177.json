South Africa is considered to be one of the invasive teams in the cricket arena and they enter the ground with the sole intention of taking the World Cup home for the first time. Despite South Africa’s intimidating play style, they were not fortunate enough to qualify for finals in the world cup history. Bangladesh, is exactly not the team to be trifled with their comeback history in the last seven years.
