The New York Times and other media named Jerome Valcke as the person responsible for a $10m transfer of funds cited in a US indictment. Fifa has denied that Mr Valcke or other managers were involved in the payment or the project it was destined for. Valcke is not under indictment. Last Wednesday, world football was rocked when seven senior Fifa officials were detained at an annual convention in Zurich, among 14 people indicted by US prosecutors. Blatter is not one of the accused. He went on to win re-election for a fifth term as Fifa president, extending his 16-year reign. Yesterday, Mr Valcke announced that he would not be attending the opening of the Women’s World Cup in Canada on 6 June as planned – a move that correspondents called “highly unusual”."}
