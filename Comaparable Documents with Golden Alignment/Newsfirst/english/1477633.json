Winning the toss Sri Lanka opted to take the first lease of the wicket. Skipper Angelo Mathews led from the front with an unbeaten captains knock of 79 runs. However, none of the other batsmen, bar one, managed to provide any sort of support for Mathews. Sri Lanka ended up with a total of 244 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in their 50 overs. Niroshan Dickwella hammered 69 runs for the hosts. Andile Phehlukwayo and Lungi Ngidi were the pick of the bowlers bagging 3 wickets each. The key difference between Sri Lanka and South Africa was partnerships. Opener Quinton de Kock led the charge for the visitors right from the get-go with a swashbuckling performance of 87 runs which included 13 boundaries and 1 six. He was ably assisted by Hashim Amla, skipper Faf du Plessis and JP Duminy who scored 43,49 and 32 respectively. South Africa reached the target in 42.5 overs with 4 wickets in hand. Quinton de Kock was adjudged the man of the match. South Africa currently lead the 5 match ODI series 2-0."}
