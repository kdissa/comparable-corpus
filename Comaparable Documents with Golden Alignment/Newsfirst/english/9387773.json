Speaking at the event the president criticised rampant development. which he said had left many parts of the world so decrepit, that people living in these areas were compelled to ” walk around with a bag of oxygen attached to them.” He accused that “certain businessmen and organisations are running their businesses solely for their love of money and with no regard for the environment.” The president marked the event by planting a tree sapling, after which a commemorative stamp was issued to mark World Wetlands Day 2016. A number of ministers and public representatives also took part in the celebrations. The president cautioned that the responsibility to protect the environment lay in a broad-based understanding between many stakeholders including ” the leaders of this country, state officials, the general public and children.”"}
