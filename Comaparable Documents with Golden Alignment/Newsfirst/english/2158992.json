He expressed the following viewsL [quote]These are baseless accusations. These are being made to mislead the Sinhala Buddhist community. It is clear to us that this government is purposelyÂ  spreading such things amongst the people of this country who have a complete understanding of the SLMC policies. During our time with the government, the Government came forward with several proposals. The government was of the view of decentralising the administration. That was something that was brought up to resolve the issues in an area where 95 percent of the population speaks Tamil. That is normal. If we take Vavuniya, there is a separate Divisional Secretariat for the Sinhala Speaking community in Vavuniya. Such a similar process was proposed for the benefit of the Tamil speaking people in the Ampara district. We held several rounds of discussions over this matter. Now that is being misinterpreted and is said that we have requested for a separate administrative district. This wrong impressions is being used by the government. We are disappointed and we condemn this.[/quote] Rauff Hakeem also responded to allegations made that the SLMC had reached an agreement with the Tamil National Alliance. [quote]When the temporary unification of the North and East took place, the SLMC was opposed to it. The rumour of an attempt to do it once again is a lie. This is being spread by Minister Wimal Weerawansa and his associate Muzammil. That needs to be made clear. There is no such agenda. The TNA reached an independent decision and so did we.[/quote]"}
