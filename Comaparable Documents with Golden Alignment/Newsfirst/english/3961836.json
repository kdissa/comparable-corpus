Ms Okawa was recognised in 2013 as the world’s oldest living person, as well as the world’s oldest living woman, by Guinness World Records. While celebrating her birthday earlier this month, Ms Okawa said that 117 years did not seem such a long time. She also said the key to a long life was getting at least eight hours of sleep a night and eating sushi – her favourite food. She said she particularly enjoyed mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice.Her birthday celebration was shown on national television in Japan.
