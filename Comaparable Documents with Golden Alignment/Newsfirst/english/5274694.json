He stated that the TNA is supporting Ranil Wickremesinghe to become the Prime Minister by imposing terms in order to pave the way to create a Federal Constitution. MP Aluthgamahe states that Ranil Wickremesinghe has finally remembered god, who he forgot was watching while he robbed the Central bank and when the country was destroyed. “But now, Ranil Wickremesinghe has remembered god. Because he knows that the god will punish him if this worsens.” – MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage"}
