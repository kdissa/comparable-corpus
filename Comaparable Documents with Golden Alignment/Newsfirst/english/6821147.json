Bolton also said the Trump administration understands that a number of countries, some close geographically to Iran, and others “may not be able to go all the way, all the way to zero immediately.” The administration is weighing whether to give some countries that have cut their purchases of Iranian oil waivers on Nov. 5, when sanctions on Iranian exports snap back."}
