Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, May said neither options the European Union had on the table were acceptable for the United Kingdom, and that the EU had concerns with Brexit because it is an ambitious arrangement for Britain’s future. May also said that if the UK were to leave the EU with no deal, Britian’s government was still committed to ensuring there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the country’s biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years, the debate over how to leave the bloc is still raging in the centre-right Conservative Party, and even in the government. May’s already fragile leadership was put under further pressure this month when the EU rejected parts of the so-called Chequers plan. But she put a positive spin on those talks, saying she was ready to consider to the EU’s concerns."}
