According to the minister, electricity has been supplied to 97.5 percent of all households. However, the remaining number of households with access to electricity remains at 400,000 according to the minister’s numbers. He said that his ministry had formulated a plan to develop the necessary infrastructure as pylons and cables to doorsteps, to ensure that the 700,000 to 800,000 thousand children currently studying by lamplight, have access to a basic essential like electricity. One of the impediments to providing an electricity connection is often the lack of valid proof of home ownership. Minister Siyambalapitiya said the government had factored this into the plan and had decided to supply electricity to households if the occupants had resided there for 10 to 15 years."}
