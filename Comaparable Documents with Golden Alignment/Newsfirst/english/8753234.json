Erandy Elizabeth Gutierrez was furious after she came to know that her friend Anel Baez had uploaded nude pictures of the duo on the social networking site. Gutierrez told Baez, also 16, that she would be lucky to survive until the end of the year, ‘Metro’ reported. “It may seem that I am very calm, but in my head I have killed you at least three times,” Gutierrez tweeted to Baez. Baez laughed off Gutierrez’s threat and invited her friend to her home in Guamuchil, Mexico to patch things up. However, Gutierrez stabbed Baez over 60 times with a knife, according to police. After the murder, Gutierrez tried to clean the blood from her clothes and the weapon, police said. Gutierrez tried to hide her role in the murder after fleeing the scene, the report said. However, she was eventually arrested at her best friend’s funeral. -TOI"}
