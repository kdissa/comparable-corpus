The application claims the ruling of the Court of Appeal is illegal and it will lead the country towards anarchy. The petition names Ranil Wickremesinghe and 121 others as respondents and requests the court to take up the appeal expeditiously and to make the order of the appeals court null and void until a decision is granted by the Supreme Court. Mahinda Rajapaksa, Johnston Fernando, Dinesh Gunawardena and others have filed two appeals with regards to the interim injunction, according to Attorney at Law Premanath C Dolawatta. It was noted that they are expecting more appeals to be filed tomorrow. Dolawatta said they expect that the case will be taken up by the supreme court as soon as possible and it will provide a justifiable verdict."}
