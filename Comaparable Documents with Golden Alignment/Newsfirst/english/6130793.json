Mr Trump has had many a criticism leveled at him and following his reaction to the speech at the Democratic National Convention by the parents of a dead US Muslim soldier, the New York real estate tycoon has come under more fire. Mr.Trump had turned his focus to two senior figures in his own party who have publicly criticized him and during an interview he refused to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John McCain, who are up for re-election in November. President Obama stated that even though there have been policy differences with previous Republican presidents and candidates he had never thought they could not function as president."}
