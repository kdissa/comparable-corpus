He noted that they warned the authorities regarding this issue in June and July 2018. Dr. Aluthge noted that Minister Rajith Senaratne has rejected their claims as completely false. He said the minister mentioned that he has a special software on his desktop computer which can identify any drug shortage around the country and immediately correct it. If so he questioned; “Where is the computer? Where is the software?” Dr. Aluthge pointed out that Minister Rajitha Senaratne is still here, but the computer and the software are missing."}
