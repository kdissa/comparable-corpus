The 37-year-old suffered the stroke while training with his club side Porto on Wednesday (May 1). The Portuguese champions said Casillas had suffered an “acute” heart attack during training, but that he was stable in hospital and “the heart problem has been resolved”. The former Real Madrid stopper also tweeted later on Wednesday: “Everything under control here, it was a big scare but I’m feeling strong. Thanks a lot for all your messages and your support.” Casillas moved to Porto in the summer of 2015 from Real Madrid and won the 2017/18 Primeira Liga crown with the Portuguese giants. He spent the majority of his career with Spanish side Real – his 725 matches between 1999 and 2015 puts him second on Real’s all-time appearances list. During that time he won five La Liga titles and three Champions League crowns. Casillas played 167 times for Spain and famously captained them to their first ever World Cup win in 2010. He also won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships with the national side and his exploits earned him the nickname ‘Saint Iker’ as well as making him one of Spain’s best-known personalities."}
