Bandula Gunawardana stated that following the defeat the two expenditure heads the subject minister and the Prime Minister will not be able to pay salaries to 550,000 people. He noted that it is not good to talk about the matters in the parliament elsewhere because other people will get the wrong idea. There will not be any problem in paying salaries because that an interim budget has been approved until April and a supplementary estimate is presented. He further stated that a separate account in the treasury to pay for emergency situations and that this account could be used to pay the salaries. Lakshman Kiriella stated that there won’t be an issue and it was taken during the party leaders meeting. He further noted that the agreement was breached by them like on October 26th. Nalinda Jayatissa stated that before Prime Minister stated that Rs 320 will be deducted due to the defeat and that he made it look like it was not a problem."}
