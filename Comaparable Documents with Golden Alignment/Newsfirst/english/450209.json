During the media briefing NFF member, Piyasiri Wijenayake expressed the following views: ” We must as soon as possible inform the general public what this point is. The opposition leader is appointed by the president and even the prime minister is appointed by the President. As the first act of the current government they should put forward an act that if a member of a certain party crosses over, his or her party membership is cancelled with immediate effect. Everyone will vote in favour of this act. Good governance should commence there. If the individuals who are put into power by the people turn that power into their own, this should be opposed. There existed the power to cancel party membership, but this was halted by a Supreme Court decision. We say that this must be implemented. We agree with such a measure .”"}
