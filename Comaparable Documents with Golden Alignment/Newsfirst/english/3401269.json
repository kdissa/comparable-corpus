Under the deal, Iran will reduce its uranium enrichment capacity in exchange for phased sanctions relief. US President Barack Obama said a “historic understanding” had been reached with Iran. The world powers and Iran now aim to draft a comprehensive nuclear accord by 30 June. The framework agreement was announced by the European Union and Iran after eight days of negotiations in Lausanne. The talks between the so-called P5+1 – the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany – and Iran at Lausanne’s Beau-Rivage Palace hotel continued beyond the original self-imposed deadline of 31 March. After a missed deadline and two exhausting nights of negotiations Iran and the six world powers presented their framework as a major achievement. The EU’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, read out a joint statement outlining the main points, including a reduction in the number of Iran’s operating centrifuges, changes to its nuclear facilities, and a promise to lift sanctions if these steps are verified. This is an unwritten understanding, not a formal agreement, and it lays the foundation for very tough negotiations on the details. But for now its architects are celebrating a hard won, potentially historic, achievement. Source: BBC"}
