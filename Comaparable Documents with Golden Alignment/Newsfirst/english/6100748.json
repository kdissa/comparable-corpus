The event was held under the auspices of President Maithripala Sirisena. The ceremony took place at the BMICH. The new website for the Institute of Emergency Medical Practitioners was also launched by the President. Speaking at the event, President Maithripala Sirisena said that the health sector is up to standard at present because of the level of dedication of the specialist doctors and nurses. He further said that the reason why our country has received a recommendation from the WHO is because of the quality and the high standards in the health sector. The President also said that as the government of the country they could only do a limited amount of things to uplift the health sector, which is in terms of physical and human resources. He added that due to a number of professionals retiring every year, and more serving overseas that the health sector has found it difficult to function with the doctors within the country, as it is insufficient to meet the national demand."}
