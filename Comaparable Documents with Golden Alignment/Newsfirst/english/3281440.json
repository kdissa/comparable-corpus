The Sri Lankan ethnic issue was mishandled which resulted in the the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, he added. In the interview, Natwar also claimed it was Rahul Gandhi’s ultimatum to “do anything” that prevented Sonia from taking up the post of prime minister in 2004, contradicting the Congress chief’s 2004 claim that she was following her “inner voice” in renouncing the high office. “Rahul was totally against her mother becoming PM. He said she would be killed like his father and grandmother and as a son he would not allow her to become the PM. He was very adamant and was prepared to take any step to prevent his mother from being PM,” Singh said, adding that being a doting mother Sonia heeded his son’s pressure. He said a meeting was held on May 18, 2004 where Manmohan Singh, Gandhi family friend Suman Dubey, Priyanka and he were present, and Priyanka conveyed Rahul’s 24-hour deadline, leading to Sonia withdraw her name and nominate Manmohan Singh for prime ministership.
