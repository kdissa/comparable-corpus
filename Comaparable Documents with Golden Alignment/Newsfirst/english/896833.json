ISA was conceived as a coalition of solar resource-rich countries to address their special energy needs and to provide a platform to collaborate on addressing and identifying issues through an agreed common approach. , The signed documents were handed over to  Nagaraj Naidu – Joint SecretaryInvestments, Technology Promotion and Energy Security Division)of the Ministry of External Affairs of India. When the agreement is ratified, Sri Lanka will become a founding member of the International Solar Alliance. The Long Term Generation Expansion Plan, approved by the PUCSL, envisions broadening of the solar power generation in the country. The plan highlights, if there are delays in implementing these Solar plants along with other renewable energy sources, it would cause impacts in capacity and energy balances. However, even late last year, ministers of the current administration made attempts to bring in more coal power under the guise of ‘clean coal’. This has been continuously rejected by the energy experts as well as environmentalists."}
