The case was filed against the Former Defence Secretary and seven others by the Bribery Commission at the Colombo Magistrate’s Court. The case charges them of causing the government a loss of 1,140 million rupees by permitting Avant Garde to operate a floating armoury. The case has been filed by the Former Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Dilrukshi Dias Wickremesinghe. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa filed an application against the case with the High Court, claiming Dias had not obtained written approval from the commission to file the case, and that her actions were illegal. However, the Justice pointed out the Director General of the Commission and the Commission itself are considered as one body, and the Commissions written approval is not required to file the case. Thereby, Rajapaksa’s application was rejected and the High Court Judge ruled the order issue by the Colombo Chief Magistrate is legal."}
