The head of state made these remarks at a May Day function in Colombo. “I got the interim report of the committee. I’m not going to disclose what was included in the reports. I’m hoping to take the necessary legal action after discussing the content of the interim report with the Attorney General tomorrow. The Defence Secretary and the Inspector General of Police had the opportunity to prevent this from taking place. But they have not fulfilled that responsibility. It is not that we have to fight the IS terror organization as we fought with the LTTE. We have to think differently now. We have to plan it in a different way. Some accuse that we are trying to bring down soldiers from other countries. No. We will not let soldiers from another country to come here. And I will not let it happen. Our security forces -Army, Navy and Airforce, Police and the STF have the potential to eradicate these terrorists. We need the support of foreign intelligence experts who are trained to eradicate terrorism. We have to think about using our brains today, not the heart. I’m certain that we will completely eradicate terrorism from our country with our security forces, intelligence units and with the support, we receive from foreign experts.”"}
