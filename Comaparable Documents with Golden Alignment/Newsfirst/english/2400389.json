The meeting was convened via social media and was marked with a massive dinner close to the epicenter of protests and the scene of clashes between police and protesters. Demonstrations and riots over inequality in Chile have raged for weeks, leaving at least 26 dead and causing billions of dollars in damages to public infrastructure and private business. According to local media, the police deployed around a thousand troops around the square, which after so many protests looks barren, with no electric power and with extensive areas of the pavement destroyed. The police did not immediately respond to a request for information."}
