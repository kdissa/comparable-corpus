The 100-metre ‘Coiling Dragon Cliff’ walk sits 1402 metres above the ground. The 330ft-long path along the mountainside is just 5ft wide, giving tourists a very clear view of the plunging valley on the other side of the barrier, according to People’s Daily Online. Brave visitors can see all the way down to the bottom of the cliff as they stand on the glass path, if they can handle the risk of vertigo. The view from that high above sea level is said to be stunning, and more than a little terrifying. Tianmen Tongtian Avenue can be seen below, which features a staggering 99 turns, People’s Daily reports.
