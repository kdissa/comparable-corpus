However, seconds later Valencia managed to score another goal when Paco Alcacer found the net with a header from close range. Valencia had the chance to win the match when substitute Alvaro Negredo was found in space at the edge of the box – but unfortunately shot straight at Madrid’d keeper Keylor Navas. Without a doubt this is the best result of Neville’s spell as Valencia boss, following a Champions League defeat, two La Liga points from three games and a Spanish Cup win over lower league Barakaldo. With Real Madrid down to 10 men Neville made attacking changes to manage a draw. After the game, Neville stated that he wants to remain at Valencia beyond his six-month contract and said that there had been a misunderstanding to his statement that he did not see himself in management long term. Rafael Benitez is more popular among Valencia fans than his own, with the home supporters thanking him for a spell which included two La Liga titles earlier. He was named Madrid boss in the summer but currently Real Madrid are four points behind long time rivals Atletico and two behind Barcelona, who have a game in hand on them. However the substitution that he made did not please the supporters or main striker Benzema who seemed to be angry about being substituted by winger Lucas Vazquez two minutes before Kovacic received a red card for tackling down Joao Cancelo. Although it seemed like Madrid were going to win when Bale headed in a goal before Alcacer’s quickfire equaliser, they did not do enough to deserve a victory."}
