The brackish water has been used to quench the thirst of the future generation for several years. Work at the Secondary School commenced on Friday July 29 to ensure a permanent clean drinking water supply for students under the Gammedda 100 days initiative. Upon witnessing the project undertaken by News 1st’s Gammedda 100 day initiative, the President took steps to implement a clean drinking water project for the people of Hambegamuwa, together with the Sri Lanka Navy. While the clean drinking water project for the children at the Hambegamuwa Secondary School is already underway, the foundation stone was laid today, August 1 for a scheme that will provide clean drinking water for the residents of several other villages. Eight hundred families in Hambegamuwa, the Diyawara village, Bimpokunugama, Seenuggalapara, Rathabalagama, Watamada and Degalaara will receive clean drinking water under the project. The project is being implemented by the Engineering Branch of the Sri Lanka Navy. Meanwhile, work on the clean drinking water project which was initiated for the people of the Borala village in Weligama is also underway."}
