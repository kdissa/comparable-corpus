Farmers from the peninsula say that if the delay at the Omanthai checkpoint can be mitigated, they will be able to supply stocks of fresh vegetables. Traders at the Dambulla Economic Centre believe that the increased supply from farmers in Jaffna has led to the reduction in the prices of vegetables. Farmers from Jaffna are supplying all types of high-grown vegetables with the exception of leeks, to the Dambulla Economic Centre at present. Jaffna farmers are supplying vegetables including non-leafy beet, brinjals, chillies, cabbage, carrots and potatoes. Traders say that the produce has to be unloaded from the trucks and loaded again at the Omanthai military checkpoint. The farmers say that this is a time-consuming exercise and that vegetables are destroyed in the process."}
