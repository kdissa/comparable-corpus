In a communique, the Association says that although resignation can only be within the realm of dreams, the public representatives must be called upon to apologise to the nation. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka issued a communique on Friday evening bearing the signature of BASL President, President’s Counsel Geoffrey Alagaratnam, over the altercation in parliament. The communique reads that such actions shame all right thinking people and bring the nation in to ridicule. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka calls upon Parliament to swiftly enact a code of ethics and standards for its members which is monitored by an independent body that where there is violation by any member, such must be visited with strict sanctions which should extend to expulsion in appropriate circumstances. The BASL notes that the best laws and codes will be ineffective unless persons of undoubted civility and integrity are elected to parliament, and such is the responsibility of the people."}
