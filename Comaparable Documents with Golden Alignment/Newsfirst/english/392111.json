Seven sections of the steel fence around the entrance road close to the Mattala International Airport have been stolen. The road in question is being managed by the Road Development Authority. A staff headed by a chief engineer has been appointed for the maintenance of the road. When News 1st questioned the director of the Road Development Authority as to why such an incident has happened despite there being a group of people to manage it, the director was not aware of the incident. Several days earlier when a fence on the expressway was damaged in an accident, measures were taken to charge more than Rs. 2 million to cover damages. Our correspondents state that at present there are no safety fences on either side of the road leading up to the Mattala International Airport."}
