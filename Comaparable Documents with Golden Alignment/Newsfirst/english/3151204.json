In a Televised address earlier in the day, President Maithripala Sirisena said that Sri Lanka was at the threshold of a decisive era of speedy and sustainable development that would be of importance, both for present and future generations. In his message, the president added that as he emphasised in his New Year wishes last year, Sri Lanka had seen the restoration of democratic freedoms, ending of corruption and violence, establishment of reconciliation, and regaining of international goodwill. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said in his New Year message that this year dawns with the refreshing promise of a new era – one that ushers in the dividends of democracy, fulfilling the long held aspirations of the people. The message further said: “It celebrates the emerging of a nation that understands and comprehends the true meaning of freedom from oppression.”"}
