But there was no need to panic, because next door was a tailor, a man who had only arrived in Canada days before after fleeing Syria’s war-torn violence, unable to speak a word of English. Ibrahim Halil Dudu did not hesitate to come to the rescue. He set about fixing the wedding dress with his sewing kit, as Ms Coulter captured the moment on camera. Speaking later to reporters through a translator, Mr Dudu said: “I was so excited and so happy. I like to help Canadian people from my heart.” Writing on Facebook Ms Coulter said: “Every weekend I take photos of people on the happiest days of their lives, and today one man who has seen some of the worst things our world has to offer came to the rescue. “I am so proud to live in Canada, a country who has opened our doors to refugees countless times. I’m in awe of the families who have welcomed these strangers in to their homes and lives, and I’m inspired by the resilience of the Syrian people. We are truly blessed.” Picture Courtesy : Social Media"}
