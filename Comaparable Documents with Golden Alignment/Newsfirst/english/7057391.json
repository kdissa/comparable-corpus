Zach Yonzon, his wife Aila, and six of his staff helped finish the 167 cm. (66-in.) chocolate cake on Saturday, May 02 after working 24 hours at The Bunny Baker cafe in suburban Quezon City. Yonzon noted it was his wife’s idea to bake the cake to commemorate the mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, which will be on Sunday morning Philippines time. Yonzon said “Manny Pacquiao is world class, so we wanted to do something equally world class and the only way to do that is to create a cake that was extraordinary.” The cake will be handed out free after the fight.
