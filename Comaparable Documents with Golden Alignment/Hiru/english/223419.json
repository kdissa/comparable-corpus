Foreign media noted that over 1000s had participated at the protest. The couple Nadeshlingam and Priya and their daughters Thaarunika and Kopikaa were extradited from Melbourne last Thursday night with the Australian migration authorities refusing to provide protection. However, owing to a court order, the flight in which they were deported, had to make a landing in Darwin Australia, nearly 3000 kms away from Melbourne. According to the counsel appearing on behalf of the couple, owing to a last minute court decision received while they were midair, the migratory couple and their children have been sent to an isolation camp in Christmas islands. Christmas Islands in located in close proximity to Indonesia’s Java island and it has been reported that refugee camps have been closed down for over several years. However, the counsel appearing on behalf of the family noted that the aim of sending them to Christmas islands isn’t clear when a court order had been received."}
