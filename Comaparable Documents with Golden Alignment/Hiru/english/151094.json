The interior ministry said the escapees from Jaw prison included a number of prisoners held on terrorism-related charges. “Policeman Abdulsalam Saif was martyred trying to deal with the terrorist elements,” it said. The authorities said four or five assailants armed with automatic rifles and pistols carried out the attack, with 10 inmates — mostly serving life sentences on terrorism charges — managing to escape. An investigation and manhunt was under way, the ministry said. Bahrain’s jails have swelled with thousands of inmates since a crackdown on dissent after pro-democracy protests in 2011 led by the Shia majority against the minority Sunni ruling family."}
