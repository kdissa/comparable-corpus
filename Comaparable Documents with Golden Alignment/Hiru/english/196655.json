The Catechism of the Church, a codified doctrine which sums up teachings, had previously stated that the death penalty could be used in some cases. It now says it is \"inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person\". Pope Francis has spoken out against executions in the past. Last October, he had said the Church's policy on the death penalty was one area where teaching was not static and could change with modern concerns."}
