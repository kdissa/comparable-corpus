Kerry is due to hold urgent talks on the situation with the UN envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, and the Saudi and Jordanian foreign ministers. A top priority, he said, was ending the violence in the northern city of Aleppo. More than 250 civilians have been killed in Aleppo in the last 10 days. A Russian defence official said earlier that negotiations were taking place to establish a ceasefire there."}
