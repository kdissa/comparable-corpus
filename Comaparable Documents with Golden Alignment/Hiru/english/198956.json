President Donald Trump has previously accused Pakistan of deceiving the US while receiving billions of dollars. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Kon√© Faulkner said the US military would aim to spend the money on other \"urgent priorities\". The move, which needs to be approved by US Congress, is part of a broader suspension announced in January. The US state department has criticized Pakistan, a key ally, for failing to deal with terrorist networks operating on its soil, including the Haqqani network and the Afghan Taliban."}
