According to a representative of the CLGF the Commonwealth should assist Sri Lanka to build up a post war democratic framework. It also states that the upcoming Commonwealth State Leaders meeting which is slated to be held in Colombo shortly should be a consortium of state leaders which also includes the participation of grass root level & civil society activists. The CLGF which comes under the purview of the Commonwealth Secretariat has initiated several programmes in Sri Lanka with the aim of assisting war ravaged countries in their post war recovery."}
