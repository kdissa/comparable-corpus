The UPFA General Secretary should nominate a qualified contestant to the Election Commission. This was after, that Supreme Court upheld today (02) a ruling by Court of Appeal on 3 rd of May this year, that Geetha Kumarasinghe cannot hold a parliamentary seat as she was a dual citizen when she was contesting the 2015 August General Election. Geetha Kumarasinghe obtained 63,955 preferential votes in the General Election held on August 17, 2016, and entered Parliament from the Galle district. She was the fifth in the preferential vote result list of the UPFA. However, thereafter, 6 voters filed a petition with the Court of Appeal challenging her election as dual citizenship holders cannot represent Parliament under the 19th amendment to the Constitution. Later, the Court of Appeal decided that Geetha Kumarasinghe was not qualified for the post as she has citizenship in Switzerland as well. In this backdrop, the second in line in the preferential vote result list, Piyasena Gamage is now entitled to the vacant seat. Gamage obtained 47,874 votes in the General Election."}
