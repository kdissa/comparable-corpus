Speaking at a press conference, Gammanpila stated that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members who are opposed to President Sirisena's policy of surrendering the party to the UNP were planning to form a new party. The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya is engaged in an attempt to form a new alliance as an alternative to the United People's Freedom Alliance, which is now a dying entity, Gammanpila added. However, the official launch of the new alliance has been postponed indefinitely, he added, saying that it will be formed once the government calls for the Local Government Elections which are long overdue. He expressed confidence in former President Mahinda Rajapaksa accepting the leadership of this new alliance."}
