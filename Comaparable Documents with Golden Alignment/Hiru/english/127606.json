Dashcam footage shows the two-year-old boy hitting the tarmac at a busy intersection as his oblivious grandpa drives away. The child can then be seen chasing after the silver color van. Thankfully the driver behind spotted the clearly distressed boy and picked him up. Yang Defu, the boy's grandpa, said: \"I was waiting at the red light. After passing the intersection a car chased after me and kept sounding the horn. \"The driver told me a kid fell out of my van. I looked back, parked my van aside, and went back to search for my grandson.\" Yang said the boot had come loose after the van was rear-ended a few days earlier. The incident took place in city of Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province. Find out the full coverage in the video below..."}
