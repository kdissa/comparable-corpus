HIRU FM commenced broadcasting on the 1st of July in 1998 and created history in the hearts and minds of many Sri Lankans by setting a new trend in the sphere of radio broadcasting. Knowledge, Comedy, Humanitarian issues, News and other Entertainment were all combined in to the programming of HIRU FM and thus brought in a refreshing breath of freshness in to the monotonous airwaves of Sri Lanka in the form of Sinhala entertainment. HIRU FM has meanwhile been the number 1 Sinhala radio station in the island for over a decade and received many awards in recognition of its innovative broadcasting. Thus under the guidance of the Chairman of Asia Broadcasting corporation Mr. Rayynor Silva, HIRU FM has come to the forefront of radio during the last 17 years providing the best entertainment for a Sinhala channel on radio. We at GOLD FM wish all the BEST to our colleagues at HIRU FM on their anniversary."}
