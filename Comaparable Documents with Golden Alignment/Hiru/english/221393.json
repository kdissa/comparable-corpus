Several members objected to the constitutional draft of the new alliance during the party central working committee meeting held yesterday. Accordingly, amendments have been proposed by several factions to the new constitution of the proposed political front titled Democratic National Front. Members of the new front are SLMC, ACPC, TNA, Jathika Hela Urumaya and United Left Front. A party symbol has not yet been introduced and, a location at Havelock Place has been mentioned as its headquarters. The new front consists of a leadership council and the power of decision-taking has been vested in this council. Nomination candidates for elections and taking disciplinary action will also be carried out by this council. However, no Section has been included in the constitutional draft on the selection of a presidential candidate. However, only 12 members including party general secretary, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Assistant leader Ravi Karunanayake, Lakshman Kiriella, Sagala Rathnayake, Navin Dissanayake, John Amaratunga, Kaavinda Jayawardana and KK Piyadasa had agreed to the draft. Party Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa and Chairman Kabeer Hashim reported having objected the draft."}
