The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 17,790 of the dead were civilians, including 3,501 children. Meanwhile more than 15,000 died in conflicts in Iraq in 2014, making it that country's worst year since 2007. Much of the violence comes as a result of advances by Islamic State and other militant groups in the two countries. US-led air strikes against IS militants, fighting between government troops and rebels in Syria, and sectarian violence in Iraq have also accounted for large numbers of deaths."}
