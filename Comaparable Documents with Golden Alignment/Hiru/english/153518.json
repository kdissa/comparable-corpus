Tear gas and water was fired at protesters when they attempted to walk towards the Presidential Secretariat. The protest against the Malabe SAITM Private Medical College began from near the Colombo Medical Faculty. Heavy traffic congestions were experienced on many roads around Colombo this afternoon due to the protest that was carried out with more than 3000 students participating. They carried out the protest march against a court order by the Colombo Magistrate Courts that stated there must be no protest held in Colombo city limits in a way that would obstruct or damage or harm the general public and vehicles. The order was decreed after police informed the court about a joint protest march being planned to be held today by the Inter University Students Federation and Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee. Accordingly, the restraining order issued had been directed at 13 respondents including Inter University Student’s Federation convener Mangala Maddumage and Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath."}
