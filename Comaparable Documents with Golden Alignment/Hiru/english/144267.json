Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the four-month window that ended on Friday brought in 64,275 declarations. All were offered immunity from prosecution in return for paying tax, a surcharge and a penalty. It is estimated that the government could raise nearly $4.5bn from the scheme. Undeclared income or \"black money\" is a huge issue in India."}
