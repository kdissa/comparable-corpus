Elite Counter-Terrorism Service troops seized control of the state TV building in Kukjali hours after launching an assault on the eastern district. Army units are also pushing into the south-eastern Judaydat al-Mufti area, according to the military. On Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the 3,000 to 5,000 militants believed to be inside Mosul, which they overran in June 2014, that there was \"no escape\" and to \"either surrender or die\"."}
