One patient needed surgery for a blood clot on the brain, the other only non-invasive treatment for swelling. But a horrifying mix-up of identification tags saw the wrong man operated on, reports say. The doctors did not realize their mistake until \"hours into the surgery when they discovered there was no blood clot\", the Daily Nation reported. The head of the Kenyatta National Hospital said the patient was \"in recovery and progressing well\" and an investigation is underway. The board regulating medical practice says such a mix-up is a first in the country. It has demanded a report from the hospital and plans to hold a hearing. (BBC)"}
