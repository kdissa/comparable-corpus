The confirmation comes on the same day when US President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of giving nothing to the US but “lies and deceit” and providing “safe haven” to terrorists in return for $ 33 billion aid over the last 15 years. “They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” Trump said, clearly indicating that Pakistan would no longer receive any security aid from the US until the time it sees a change in behaviour from them in the fight against terrorism. Within hours, the Pakistani Defence Ministry fired back, alleging that it has got “nothing but invective and mistrust” for all the actions it took in support of America’s war against terrorism. “Pak as anti-terror ally has given free to US: land and air communication, military bases and intel cooperation that decimated Al-Qaeda over last 16yrs, but they have given us nothing but invective and mistrust. They overlook cross-border safe havens of terrorists who murder Pakistanis,” the Pakistan Defence Ministry said in a tweet."}
