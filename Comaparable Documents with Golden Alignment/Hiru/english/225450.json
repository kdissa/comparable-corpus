The petition that seeks a stay order on the citizenship of SLPP presidential candidate, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was taken before the Court of Appeal today. Meanwhile, deputy solicitor general Nerin Pulle who appeared for a respondent of the petition, Controller of Immigration and Emigration, stated that the Immigration and Emigration Department does not possess any documents relating to the dual citizenship and the passport of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The deputy solicitor General quoted the Controller of Immigration and Emigration as saying that the reason for misplacing such documents is computerizing all documents and relocating the office in 2008. Meanwhile, the hearing of the petition seeking an order from court against recognizing the citizenship of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna presidential candidate Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, has been postponed to 1.30pm tomorrow. Our court correspondent stated that the lawyers appearing on behalf of the petitioners presented their arguments in court today."}
