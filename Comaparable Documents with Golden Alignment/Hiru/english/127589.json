The group, four individuals between 25 to 58 years of age, have used lyrics from a Notorious Big song to communicate the import of 31 guns. The guns - 22 assault rifles similar to AK-47s, and nine Skorpion sub-machine guns - were worth more than £100,000 and were brought into Kent from Boulogne in France on a 38ft (12m) cruiser, the MV Albernina. Accused Harry Shilling and Michael Defraine have used lyrics from Notorious Big’s Gimme the Loot. An encrypted message they shared read, \"I'm ready to got this paper g you with me... my pockets looking kinda tight and I'm stressed yo munky let me get the vest\". And, \"We now officially gangsters\", in a separate message."}
