Our correspondent stated that a large number of Lorries loaded with paddy has arrived at the premises. Paddy storing in the goods terminal was compelled to be halted in the morning after a group of residents and another group of airport workers staged a protest against the activities. However, protesters were dispersed from the scene after police informed them that minimum force would be used to do so. Meanwhile, Paddy Marketing Board Chairman M.B. Dissanayake said that permission was obtained from the Civil Aviation Services Authority to store paddy in the cargo terminal of the Mattala Airport. At the same time, long queues of farmers waiting to sell their paddy were seen in several paddy cultivating areas of the country today as well. Meanwhile, All Ceylon Farmers Federation stated that it would bring the paddy farmers to the streets, if remedial actions are not taken without delay. Addressing a media conference held in Dambulla today, Federation National Organizer and JVP North Western Provincial Councilor Namal Karunarathna said the first protest against this government would commence with paddy farmers."}
