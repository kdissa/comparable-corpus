She said the principal of the Dhammissara National School has taken no step to admit her child to school even after five months of the year were passed since the application was submitted. Our news team tried to contact principal of the Dhammissara National School R.L.Gunasekara but failed as he had gone out for a meeting. However Deputy Principal of the school Prabha Priyadarshani said that the parents of the affected child should discuss the matter with the school principal and find a settlement. Our correspondent in Nattandiya said that State Resources and Enterprise Development Minister Dayasrita Tissera also visited the scene and looked into the matter."}
