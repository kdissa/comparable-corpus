The bill, which was signed in private at the White House, also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea. Trump accused Congress of overreach on the legislation, which \"handcuffs\" him from easing Russia penalties. Moscow said the sanctions \"put paid to hopes that our relations with the new American administration\" would improve. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also said this move meant the US had declared a \"full-scale trade war\" on Russia."}
