At the same time, the Opposition leader of the 8 th parliament has not yet been revealed as yet. UNP, TNA, JVP and SLMC stated in unison that an elected member from a political party that does not take part in the national government should be appointed to the Opposition leader post. However, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as well as NFF stated that the post should be given to the SLFP as majority of the opposition benches to be filled with MPs of the SLFP. ‘Who should be appointed as the Opposition leader?’ took centre stage at a media conference convened by the Citizen’s movement in Colombo today. Post of Opposition Leader - to Kumara Welgama or Sambanthan? By now two factions have requested that the post of Opposition Leader be given to them. A letter signed by 56 UPFA MPs requesting that MP Kumara Welgama be made the Opposition Leader has been handed over to President Maitripala Sirisena. Expressing his views to our news team, MP Ranjith Soysa said that through the same letter it is also requested that MP Mahindananda Aluthgamagey be appointed the Chief Opposition Whip. However MP Kumara Welgama participating in the 8 th Parliament’s maiden session yesterday stated as follows in reference to the subject. Meanwhile TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran said that the party proposed TNA leader R. Sambandan’s name for the post of Opposition Leader."}
