It is to resolve the issue of the Presidential candidacy and the New Alliance that has still not been resolved. The meeting will be held on the 5th after the Prime Minister's returns from his official visit to the Maldives. There have been four solutions proposed to resolve the crisis of the United National Front. This includes suggestions regarding designations to be assigned for the UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the deputy leader Sajith Premadasa. However, leader of the Tamil Progressive Alliance, Mano Ganeshan, who represents the United National Front, stated that the UNP leadership has not given their final consent to any of these suggestions."}
