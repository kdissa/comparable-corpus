The Chief Minister said this in response to several queries posted by journalists via email last week. The Northern Province Chief Minister had said that neither a single member nor several members representing the TNA have the right to take an arbitrary decision. Meanwhile, TNA will meet tomorrow (Apr. 03) with Opposition Leader R. Sambanthan at the chair to take a decision regarding the ‘no-confidence motion’. That will be held at the Parliamentary complex. However, responding to a query, the Opposition Leader R. Sambanthan said that so a final decision had not so far been made to meet the President or the Prime Minister. Similarly, the EPRLF led by former TNA MP Suresh Premachandran met with the Prime Minister today. Meanwhile, the JVP parliamentary group is scheduled to meet at Parliamentary complex tomorrow.
