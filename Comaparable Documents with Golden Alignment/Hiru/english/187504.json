The Nayake Theras have especially pointed out the damage being caused to the tradition and the genuine Bhikkhu community by certain persons who have been acting in the guise of Buddhist monks while being involved in wrongdoings. The Nayake Theras have emphasized in their letter to the President that it is high time the Bhikkhu Identity Card was regularized to expel such persons from the Buddha Sasana."}
