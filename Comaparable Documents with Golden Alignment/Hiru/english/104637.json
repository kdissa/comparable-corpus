While attending a ceremony held at Rukmale Sri Dharmavijayaloka Maha Vihara in Pannipitiya yesterday, the Prime Minister stated that the UN Human Rights Council too has nothing to hide regarding Sri Lanka. The ceremony was organized to felicitate Venerable Doctor Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera for assuming the position of Chief Prelate of Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Council. While expressing his views at the occasion, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that promises and pledges made to the people should be met. He also said that it would be a great blow to the campaign if someone tried to pull racism at this juncture. Furthermore, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that they have made a special proposal to make a list of names of all those who have been detained in prisons. He added that if someone’s name was not found in this list, then that person is not alive or has migrated to another country."}
