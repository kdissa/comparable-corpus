Gen Qi Jianguo, deputy chief of staff of the People's Liberation Army, insisted that China wanted peaceful development alongside its neighbours. He insisted on China's sovereignty to the Diaoyu islands but distanced it from claims to the Okinawa group. General Qi, who is also China's head of military intelligence, was speaking at a security conference in Singapore - the Shangri-La dialogue - where China's military behaviour has been questioned."}
