The petition was taken up before Colombo High Court Judge, Sampath Wijerathna. The former Defence Secretary requested in his petition that he be acquitted of all charges in the Avant-Garde floating armoury case. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had sued 8 including the former Defence Secretary over this incident. The suspects are accused of incurring a loss of Rs. 114 million to the state by permitting Avant-Garde to maintain a floating armoury. In the revised petition, the former Defence Secretary said that former Director General of the Bribery Commission had sued him and the other 7 respondents, without obtaining a written approval. The former Defence Secretary had also requested the court to rule that the action by the Bribery Commission as being unlawful.
