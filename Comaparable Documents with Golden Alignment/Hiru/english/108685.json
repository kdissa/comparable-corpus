An EU official said most are thought to have been trekking in the Everest or remote Langtang regions, while many are hoped to be alive but isolated by the quake. The fate of thousands in remote communities is also unknown. Nepal has called for more foreign help and humanitarian aid, admitting it was ill-prepared for the disaster."}
