The Judge also issued notice on all suspects and 12 witnesses including the Russian national Victoria Aleksandrovna who was allegedly raped after murdering her boyfriend. The suspects were charged for allegedly murdering a British tourist Khuram Shaikh at a tourist resort and raping his girl friend at Tangalle in 2011. The High Court judge also told in the open Court that the Court is not a kindergarten. Later she warned the suspects that those who commit serious crimes should not try to make the Court a joke. Earlier, the Court had informed the suspects to submit declaration of income of 3 guarantors for each suspect to the value of 500 thousand rupees each. Later the Judge adjourned the hearing until 2pm as the guarantors who submitted their declaration of income had failed to prove the ceiling of the required income. New guarantors were brought in when the case was taken again in the afternoon and the Judge warned the suspects that out-side criminals cannot enter the Court premises. Later she released the suspects on previous bail grants and said that only those who are wanted in connection with the case should come into the Court chambers. The High Court judge then ordered the new guarantors to submit their declaration of income to the Court before the 9th of January 2014."}
