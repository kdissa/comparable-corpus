When the motion was called before Colombo High Court Judge Shashi Mahendran previously, the lawyers for the defendant Shanil Neththikumara requested that his client be allowed to travel overseas to attend the World Energy Congress Consultation to be held in Dubai. The Attorney General objected and the Judge directed the defendantâ€™s attorneys to submit to Court any detailed evidence to support his request to go overseas. When the motion was called before Colombo High Court Judge Shashi Mahendran, the lawyer appearing for the defendant informed the court that his client's father had undergone an emergency surgery and therefore he will not submit the request to go overseas. Accordingly, he requested the court to allow the motion to be withdrawn. The High Court Judge granted permission to withdraw the motion, the case will be taken up again on the 5th of this month."}
