The man was captured with other three other suspected militants in a raid on a bomb-making site in Gereshk district. His identity is unclear. Officials say he speaks German and says he is German. If confirmed, it would be a rare case of a Westerner fighting with insurgents in Afghanistan. Large parts of Helmand are under Taliban control. Afghan officials believe the man has been with the Taliban for eight years. An army statement said: \"The German national calls himself Abdul Wadood.\" His German name is not known."}
