The paper was scheduled to be distributed at 8.30am but instead it had been served at 9.30am. When our news team contacted the Department of Examinations, its spokesman said the paper was distributed late as the invigilator was delayed in   reporting to the centre. However the spokesman said that the delayed time was restored without causing any injustice to the students. He also said that disciplinary action would be taken against the invigilator."}
