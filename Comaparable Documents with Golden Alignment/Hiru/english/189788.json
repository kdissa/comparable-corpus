Jyotirmoy Dey was shot dead by four men on motorcycles who were acting on the orders of Rajan, the court found. Journalist Jigna Vora and another accused were acquitted of any role in the murder for lack of evidence. Rajan, who has been in custody since 2015 after he was extradited from Indonesia, is awaiting sentencing. He was convicted by the court in Mumbai along with eight of his aides. One suspect is still being sought by police, while another died in 2015. Although 155 witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution, there were no eyewitnesses to the murder."}
