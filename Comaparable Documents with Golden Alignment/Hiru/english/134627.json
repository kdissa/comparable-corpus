The United States has said that it is looking forward to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the country next week and asserted that they wanted it to be a successful visit in all aspects. “We look forward to the Prime Minister’s visit and we want it to be successful,” State Department Spokesman John Kirby said in a press briefing in Washington. He further said that when US held talks with Indian officials, the topics ranged from regional to global issues and were not only limited to discussions about the two nations. “There’s no question that in routine meetings, bilateral meetings, we talk about all manner of regional, even global issues. They’re not just issues between the United States and India,” Kirby added.
