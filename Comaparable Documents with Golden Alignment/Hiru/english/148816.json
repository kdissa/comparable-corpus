Chairman of the Federation of All Ceylon Private Bus companies Anjana Priyanjith told our news team all private bus trade unions have agreed to the decision. Meanwhile, the chairman of Matara Passenger Transport Association Aruna Halpe said all Colombo bound buses from Matara are still continuing the strike.
