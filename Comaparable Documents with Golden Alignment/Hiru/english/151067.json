The subsequent news cycle found itself populated by viral rebuttals by Vladimir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump, though Obama remained largely silent on the matter. Nor did he publicly say anything noteworthy during the final days leading up to Saturday’s worldwide celebrations. President-elect Donald Trump, however, not so much. Trump took to Twitter on the morning of New Year’s Eve offer a tongue-in-cheek happy new year to his “enemies” and “those who have fought me.” All that changed Sunday afternoon when Obama took a page from Trump’s own playbook and took to Twitter to ring in the new year. “As we look ahead to the future,” he tweeted via the official @POTUS account, “I wanted to take a moment to look back on the remarkable progress that you made possible these past 8 years.”"}
