He alleged that cases against him and his family were being fabricated and that the Panama Papers case verdict became a source of embarrassment [for the nation]. Despite all these reservations, Sharif said he would appear before courts to show his respect for the judiciary notwithstanding the ailment of his wife Begum Kulsoom, who needs his presence as per doctorsâ€™ advice. The former first lady underwent a second round of chemotherapy in London yesterday."}
