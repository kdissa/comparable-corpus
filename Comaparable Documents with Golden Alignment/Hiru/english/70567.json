But following talks at the White House, nearly two years after the last US soldier left Iraq, Obama did not unveil any new offer of military aid. He stressed the importance of an inclusive and democratic Iraq. Maliki's visit to Washington DC, his first since 2011, comes as bloodshed hits a five-year high in Iraq."}
