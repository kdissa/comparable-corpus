Train commuters also charged that train fares had been increased  in an unusual manner and that  season ticket fares had also been raised. The train fare increase was implemented yesterday. Contrary to this, The Railway department stated that under this revision there would be no changeton  the minimum fares of 10, 20 and 40 rupees in the third, second and first classes respectively. It was also stated that the distance that could be travelled under the minimum fare had been reduced from 10 kilometres to seven kilometres.

In some instances, a trip that previously cost 10 rupees was to cost 15 rupees because of the distance being travelled.
