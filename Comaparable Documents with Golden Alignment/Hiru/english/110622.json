The arrest comes days after the Indian fishermen set out to the sea at the end of a 48-day ban on fishing. According to the representatives of fishermen's associations, a group of fishermen in 734 boats had gone for fishing in the sea last evening and as the fish availability was very poor, they had crossed over to the Sri Lankan territory. In anticipation of the Indian fishermen invading Sri Lankan waters when they set out to sea after the temporary suspension, the Sri Lankan Navy has deployed several ships and more than 10 naval boats along the International Maritime Boundary Line to prevent the Indian fishermen from crossing over into Sri Lanka's territorial waters."}
