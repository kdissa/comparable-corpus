The protestors stated that although many accidents have taken place at this railway crossing before, authorities still have not addressed the issue despite the number of requests made. The protestors further noted that school children from four nearby villages too travel across this railway crossing. Meanwhile, it was reported that the express train plying from Kandy to Matara this morning stopped for a few minutes in Doowemodara – Kosgoda due to the protest. When we inquired in this regard from the Railway Operating Superintendent, Wijaya Samarasinghe, he stated that the protestors were informed to provide a document in writing stating the need for a railway gate. Meanwhile, a woman died this morning at a railway crossing near Alawwa railway station after being hit by an express train plying from Vavuniya to Colombo Fort. Our correspondents stated that the deceased is a 55 year old resident of Alawwaththa area in Alawwa."}
