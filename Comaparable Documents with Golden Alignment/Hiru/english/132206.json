Speaking at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) May Day Rally in Galle, he pointed out that the federal demand came from the north even in the 40s, 50s and 60s. The government should take an appeasing approach and grant the rights of the people of the country if it needs to move forward, he added. President Sirisena also said that it was the responsibility of the people to safeguard the hard-won democracy and called upon all people to join hands with the government to achieve this goal."}
