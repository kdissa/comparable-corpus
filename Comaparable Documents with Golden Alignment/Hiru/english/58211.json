Accordingly no adjustments would be made to electricity tariffs until 60 units. Moreover under the Presidents directives the 60 unit price would apply for the 61 to 66 unit category while the 90 unit price would apply to the 91 to 96 unit category. However the JVP as well as the UNP are of the opinion that existing electricity tariff revisions should be wiped out as a whole. Spokesperson for the Coordination Committee for a JointÂ Trade Union Alliance Wasantha Samarasinghe expressing his views in this regard during a media briefing which was convened today, stressed that if the government fails to reduce electricity tariffs as a whole prior to the 20 th of May, trade unions would resort to a island wide strike. Voice cut_05_02_Wasantha JVP MP Sunil Handunneththi meanwhile had this to say during a media briefing which was convened by his party today. Chairman of the Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya UNP MP Dr. Jayalath Jayawardhana also observed that electricity tariffs should be restored to their former price scheme. Meanwhile Leader of the Democratic National Alliance Sarath Fonseka expressed these views with regards to the revisions in electricity tariffs."}
