The FMM made this request issuing a statement for International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, which is marked today (02). The organization says it regrets to emphasize the fact that no justice has been delivered for the deliberate crimes against journalists in Sri Lanka. The proposed Presidential Commission of Inquiry should have a comprehensive mandate for investigations. FMM has been campaigning for this for the last 25 years. “However, no justice has been delivered to the deliberate crimes against journalists and media institutions that launched in order to suppress the freedom of expression and right to information”, the FMM added. The statement said, “Murder, attempted murders, disappearances, abductions, and torture of journalists, as well as attacks against media institutions, have been reported in Sri Lanka. We emphasize that the responsibility lies with the Government of Sri Lanka for the investigation and punishing the perpetrators”. The United Nations have nominated the 2nd November as the day to end impunity for crimes against journalists, due to this worldwide trend of impunity. Therefore, Free Media Movement has urged the President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission with a comprehensive mandate in order to complete the ongoing investigations and to expedite the process of litigation."}
