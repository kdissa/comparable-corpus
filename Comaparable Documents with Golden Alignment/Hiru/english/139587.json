The Pentagon says, that the strikes targeted positions in the port city of Sirte, an IS stronghold. However, Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, said the strikes caused \"heavy losses\", and Western powers have become increasingly concerned at IS's growing presence in Libya. The air strikes are the first such US military intervention co-ordinated with the Libyan unity government."}
