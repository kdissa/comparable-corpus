He told reporters debris was found across a 20sq km-wide area of Sinai. So far 163 bodies have been found. Russia observed a day of mourning yesterday after its worst air disaster. Jihadists allied to so-called Islamic State in Sinai, had made a claim on social media that they had brought down flight KGL9268. But Egyptian Prime Minister Sharif Ismail said experts had confirmed that a plane could not be downed at 31,000ft, the altitude the Airbus 321 was flying at, by weapons the militants are known to possess."}
