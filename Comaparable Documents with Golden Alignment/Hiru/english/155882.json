Testifying before the Commission, Additional Director of the Statistics Department of the Central Bank Dr. Mohamed Zeid said that during his tenure in the Central Bank, none of the previous Governors attended the bond issues likewise Arjuna Mahendran did. Meanwhile, the State Counsel questioned about the controversial gazette notification during the testifying. At that juncture, Commissioner Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardana said that it was unnecessary to make the particular gazette a point to disturb the sessions of the Commission. Meanwhile, Dr. Zeid said that a post observation was conducted after the bidding was over. It was revealed later that the Bank of Ceylon which bid a small amount at first has made a second bidding for 13.58 billion rupees that covered the total money required by the government. Concluding his evidence today, Dr. Zeid said that all biddings were categorized in favour of the government and were forwarded to the Tender Board later."}
