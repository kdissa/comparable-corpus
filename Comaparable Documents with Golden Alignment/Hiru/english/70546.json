India's level of participation in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka from the 15th of next month is an issue of high priority and the Indian government is considering all aspects of national interest to make a decision. The official spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs of India, Syed Akbaruddin said a process has been set in motion to arrive at a decision on the matter and the process \"has not reached its culmination.\" Meanwhile, India’s First Post says that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may be travelling to Sri Lanka to attend CHOGM. It also says India’s UPA government has allowed so much of political heat and dust to be kicked up on the question of Manmohan Singh’s participation at the Colombo CHOGM, considering the diplomatic, strategic and foreign policy imperatives. Even now when barely a fortnight’s time is remaining for the event, the Indian diplomatic circles are still considering the pros and cons of the visit. Diplomatically, India cannot afford to snub its closest neighbour with whom it has had ties for over 2500 years and that too at a time when rivals like China and Pakistan are waiting in the wings to occupy whatever space India cedes. After all, it was India only that had batted so valiantly on behalf of Sri Lanka four years ago and argued that the next CHOGM summit should take place in Sri Lanka."}
