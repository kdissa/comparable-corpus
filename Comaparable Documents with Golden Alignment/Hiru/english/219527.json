In a communiqu√©, he says that a Twitter message issued by the American Ambassador would not be sufficient to this effect. He said that the discussions the two factions already had in the Foreign Affairs ministry should also be publicized. MP Weerawansa further said that the American Ambassador should explain the need to sign this agreement if her country does not want a military installation in this country. Earlier, American Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Alaina B Teplitz stated in a Twitter message that the United States has neither an intention nor a plan to set up a military base in Sri Lanka."}
