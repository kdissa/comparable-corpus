It comes after the North's leader Kim Jong-un said he was considering sending a team to Pyeongchang in South Korea for the Games in February. He said the two sides should \"urgently meet to discuss the possibility\". South Korea's president said earlier he saw the offer as a chance to improve the highly tense relationship. South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon proposed today (Jan. 02) that representatives could meet at Panmunjom, the so-called \"truce village\"."}
