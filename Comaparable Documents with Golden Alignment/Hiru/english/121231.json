The men were sentenced to death by a military court and are the first to be hanged in relation to the attack. Taliban militants stormed the Army Public School in the north-western city of Peshawar on 16 December 2014. The hangings come just two weeks ahead of the anniversary of the attack, which shocked the nation. The massacre prompted a crackdown on Islamist militants, the establishment of military courts to try terror suspects and the resumption of capital punishment after a six-year moratorium. Earlier this week, Army Chief General Raheel Sharif signed death warrants for the four militants who were named as Maulvi Abdus Salam, Hazrat Ali, Mujeebur Rehman and Sabeel. 'Shooting indiscriminately' Security officials said the four men were executed early on Wednesday at a jail in the north-western city of Kohat. They were convicted in a military court of aiding and abetting the militants who carried out the attack, all of whom were killed in battle with security forces on the day. During the assault, militants scaled the walls to get into the school and set off a bomb before moving from classroom to classroom shooting indiscriminately at both children and teachers. The school was near a military complex in Peshawar and a number of its students were the children of military personnel. Peshawar, which is close to the Afghan border, has seen some of the worst of the militant violence to assail the country over the last decade."}
