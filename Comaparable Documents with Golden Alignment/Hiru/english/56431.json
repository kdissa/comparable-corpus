In a statement, it said the move would bolster North Korea's nuclear forces \"in quality and quantity\". The move is the latest in a series of measures by Pyongyang in the wake of its third nuclear test in February. It has been angered by the resultant UN sanctions and joint US-South Korea annual military drills. In recent weeks the communist state has issued a series of threats against both South Korean and US targets, to which the US has responded with high-profile movements of advanced aircraft and warships around the Korean peninsula."}
