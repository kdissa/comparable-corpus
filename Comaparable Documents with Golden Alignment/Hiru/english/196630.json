Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf emerged as the largest party in the July 25 election. Earlier this week, reports suggested that he wanted to invite SAARC leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi to his oath ceremony. Meanwhile, former Indian cricketer and Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said that he would travel to Pakistan to attend the swearing-in of Imran Khan as prime minister. Out of all the personalities invited to the August 11 ceremony from India, Sidhu is probably the first to confirm his acceptation. Besides Sidhu, Khan has also invited Bollywood actor Aamir Khan and former cricketers Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar. Calling the Pakistan prime minister-in-waiting a “man of character”, Sidhu said sportsmen have the ability to build bridges and unite people. “It is (a) great honour, I accept the invitation. Men of genius are admired, men of power are feared, but men of character are trusted. Khan Sahab is a man of character. He can be trusted. Sportsmen build bridges, break barriers, unite people,” the former cricketer said."}
