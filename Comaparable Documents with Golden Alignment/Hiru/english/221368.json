Each of the accused was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs. 25,000 and two sureties of LKR 5 million each. The case filed by the Attorney General on 36 charges was taken up before the three-member Special High Court Trial-at-Bar Bench comprising of Justices Vickum Kaluarachchi, Dhammika Ganepola and Adithya Patabandi. When the case was taken up on the 25th of July the suspects were remanded until the completion of the case, since the Attorney General was not in favour of granting bail. However, the Colombo High Court today ordered that release of eight suspects including Ali Roshan following a renewed plea by the defense lawyers. The case will be called up again on the 3oth of August."}
