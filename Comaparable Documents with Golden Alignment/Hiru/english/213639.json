Consideration of the complaint had to be suspended as the witness fainted in the witness box while giving evidence. Reports state that the chairman of  the President’s Commission had given a stern warning to the witness, as  he was not responding appropriately to questions being asked by State Attorneys. The witness has been asked to re appear before the commission today to complete his submission of evidence."}
