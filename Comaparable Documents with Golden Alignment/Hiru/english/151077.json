Citilink had denied the pilot was drunk when initial reports emerged on Wednesday but suspended him following the release of the footage. He was later sacked. In the footage the pilot is barely able to walk through the security check at Juanda International Airport in Surabaya, and struggles to collect his belongings from the X-ray conveyor belt. Incredibly, captain Tekad Purna was allowed to board the plane but passengers rioted when they heard him over the PA. Mobile phone footage filmed by a passenger captured the chaos in the cockpit."}
