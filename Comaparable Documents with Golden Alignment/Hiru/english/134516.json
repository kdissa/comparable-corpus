The party stated that such political interference has caused a collapse in the public service sector. Meanwhile, Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansuriya ordered to acquit JVP MP Vijitha Herath from drunk driving charges this morning. The Welikada Police filed Action against MP Herath for a motor accident that occurred at Rajagiriya last Tuesday night. The Welikada police charged MP Herath for reckless and drunk driving, and the failure to prevent an accident. However, the Magistrate stated that there was no sufficient evidence to prove the MP had driven a vehicle under the influence of liquor. The Magistrate ordered the MP to pay state fee of Rs. 1500 and concluded the Case after MP Herath pleaded guilty for the other two offences."}
