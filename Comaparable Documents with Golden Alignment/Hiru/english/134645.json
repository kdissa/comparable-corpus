They came up with the idea after the Pakistani-born intelligence officer with the British Army said that Bollywood tunes would annoy ISIS, which considers music un-Islamic. As part of a force known as the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), British forces are training Libyan troops on how to drive out ISIS from the town of Sirte and a 185-km stretch of the Libyan coastline. The psychological operations unit intercepted ISIS communications and blasted them with Bollywood chart music, in direct retaliation of the Sharia law imposed inside Sirte banning all things western or frivolous. Bollywood songs will be seen as a huge insult by the terror outfit. British and Libyan soldiers also dumped two cars with Bollywood music blaring out near Sirte."}
