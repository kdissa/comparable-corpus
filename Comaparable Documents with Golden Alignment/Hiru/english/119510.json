The people who use every chance to abuse dogs, leave them abandoned on streets, poison them, or kill them. In a parallel world to the cruelty, we still find dogs loyal and are there for people when they need to be.  No matter how much hatred and abuse they received from humans; they will still be there for us, saving us from any danger, and making the world an amazing place with their loyalty and love. This story shows how noble dogs are, whether they are living in a home or astray, their hearts and morals are the same. It all started in one of Oman’s streets, when a stray dog was roaming around to find food, but found something shocking and unbelievable instead. The dog found a newborn baby only a few hours old, with its umbilical cord still attached to it.  Who is the heartless person who did this? How can someone throw their baby that way? What would this dog do? The dog came closer to the baby.  It carried it between its jaws, and went towards a house nearby.  The dog placed the baby by the front door, and started to bark.  It was clear that it wanted someone’s attention to help rescue the baby.  The family who were living in the house, noticed the loud barks, and were shocked when they opened the door to find the baby at their footsteps. The family rushed the new born to the hospital, and the miraculously the baby was still alive. The baby was saved, only because of this thoughtful and smart dog. Sometimes, dogs can act more humane than humans. The parents of this baby managed to dump it like a piece of trash, but was thankfully saved by a dog. The dog that was most probably stoned by people to keep it away from them."}
