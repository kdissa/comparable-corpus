More than 10 million people were expected to cast ballots on Saturday, on top of four million who voted early. Polls indicated a neck-and-neck race between the two major parties. Minor party candidates are expected to take seats and a hung parliament is possible. While the government is expected to hold some key marginal seats, Labor is certain to improve upon the 55 seats it currently holds in the lower house. The Greens and South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon's newly formed pro-protectionism party are also expected to take seats. However, the UK's decision to leave the EU appears to have benefitted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull."}
