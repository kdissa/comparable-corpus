Director of the Unit, Doctor Samitha Ginige said that it is important to drink boiled water and consume properly cooked foods to avoid contracting such deceases. Meanwhile, 173,000 dengue patients have been reported so far this year. Although the situation was brought under control, rains experienced recently could once again increase the risk of dengue, the doctor said."}
