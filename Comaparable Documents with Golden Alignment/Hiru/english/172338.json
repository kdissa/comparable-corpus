The Examination Department has already said that the grade 5 scholarship examination results would be released on 5th this month. However, Lanka Teachers’ Union General Secretary, Joseph Stalin told our news team that the report called for by the Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam should be known before the scholarship examination results are released. Meanwhile, the father of a student who had sat the scholarship examination said that there was a problem in a question of the examination paper. Our attempts to speak to Examinations Commissioner, W.
