The Lorengau hospital is 25 kilometres from the detention centre where more than 700 male asylum seekers have been detained. The death is the second suicide on Manus in the past two months. The man, a Sri Lankan Tamil, is the sixth asylum seeker to die since Australia's offshore immigration detention centre in Papua New Guinea was re-opened four years ago. \"We lost one more brother today,\" Ezatullah Kakar, a Pakistani asylum seeker wrote on Twitter. The Refugee Action Coalition's Ian Rintoul said there were no facilities on Lorengau to provide proper assistance to mentally distressed people. \"The death has increased the anxiety and distress among all the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus as they struggle with their own circumstances,\" he said. \"There are two other extremely mentally distressed people who urgently need assistance.\""}
