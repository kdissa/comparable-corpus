In 2011 the DNA sample that was unidentified had been compared with the recently discovered DNA sample , and it was found to be a match with the DNA model developed back in 1998. Following this revelation the victims father, had requested that a case agains thte sri lankan national be taken up in Thegu courts, but because of the time lapsed since the case was first filed, exceeding 10 years, the courts had rejected the case.
