China’s Manned Space Engineering Office has confirmed the space station has re-entered the atmosphere and mostly burned up. It has landed in the South Pacific after it re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere at 10.16am AEST. Only about 10 percent of the bus-sized, 8.5-tonne spacecraft will likely survive being burned up on re-entry, mainly its heavier components such as its engines."}
