But a different kind of protest was reported today from the Medhankara Maha Vidyalaya in Horana. A group of parents staged a protest outside the school today threatening to hurl mud at school Principal K.A. Senarathna. Principal Senarathna has allegedly assaulted Year 11 student Oshan Praboda for not participating in the ‘Sil’ campaign held on Poson Poya day. Oshan Praboda’s mother told our news team that she had made a complaint to the Horana police with regard to the incident. However Horana police quoted the Judicial Medical Officer of Horana saying that the student was not subject to any brutal assault. Another group of parents who also staged a protest in support of the Principal commented on the incident to our news team."}
