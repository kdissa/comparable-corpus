Pujith Jayasundera and Hemasiri Fernando had been asked to record statements today but both of them did not turn up at the CID accordingly. Earlier, the Attorney General informed the Acting IGP to name Pujith and Hemasiri as respondents of the Easter Sunday bomb attacks as there is sufficient evidence against them. The order was issued on the recommendations made by the special investigation conducted against them. At the same time, coordinating officer of the Attorney General and state counsel, Nishara Jayarathna quoted the special investigation report as saying that the IGP and the former defence secretary have gravely neglected their duty and responsibility and failed to prevent the deadly attack on Easter Sunday."}
