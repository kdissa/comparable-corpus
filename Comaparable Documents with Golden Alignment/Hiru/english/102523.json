Eri Kaneko at the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General said that advancing accountability, like other parts of the post-war agenda in Sri Lanka, will lay the basis for the country to make further progress on peace, democracy and development. Kaneko said the UN stands ready to support Sri Lankaâ€™s efforts to address the post-war agenda, as the UN has consistently affirmed. Kaneko also said that the Secretary-General supports the efforts of Office of the High Commissioner for Human Right to help Sri Lanka make progress on accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka and that the UN will continue to work with the new administration in a constructive and comprehensive manner to assist Sri Lanka in addressing the post-war issues."}
