The special court acquitted 36 others in the so-called Gulbarg Society killings in Ahmedabad city. A mob attacked the complex, hacking and burning 69 people to death. The riots were some of the worst since Indian independence. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died after a train fire killed 60 Hindu pilgrims. Muslims were blamed for starting the train fire, and Hindu mobs eager for revenge went on the rampage through Muslim neighbourhoods in towns and villages across Gujarat during three days of violence that followed. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was the state chief minister at the time, say he did little to stop the riots. The Gulbarg residential complex in Ahmedabad was one of the targets where many Muslims were burnt to death and their properties set on fire. On Thursday, 11 people were convicted of murder in connection with the attack, while the others were found guilty of lesser charges. Among those convicted is a local leader of the hardline Hindu group Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). Sentencing is scheduled for Monday."}
