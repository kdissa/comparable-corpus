The incident occurred this morning (02) and the victim was Namal Sathincha Dilhan, who was a pre-school student. It was revealed the boy's mother had passed away when he was just 2 months old and since then he was looked after by his step-mother. The step-mother had said that since today was a holiday in his Montessori, the boy was playing behind the house, with a mamoty. A little later, she had noticed that the boy was not there. Then she had called his husband about it. When looked around, they have noticed the boyâ€™s pair of slippers were floating inside an unprotected well. Although the boy was rescued with the help of the neighbours, the boy was pronounced dead when he was taken to the hospital. The postmortem was held at the Dambulla Hospital while a special police team has been assigned to probe this incident further."}
