The government decided to reduce 10 rupees per litre of Octane 92 and 7 rupees per litre of Auto diesel. However, IOC franchise filling station owners and their workers stated that they have not received instruction to do so as yet. Meanwhile, our attempt to contact IOC Managing Director, Siddharth Agrawal to comment on the matter failed. At the same time, private bus owners unions are considering reducing bus fares after the price of diesel was reduced.
