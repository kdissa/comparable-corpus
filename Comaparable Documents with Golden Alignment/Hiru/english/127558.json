Diego Dzodan was thus arrested after he repeatedly refused to comply with court orders to hand over data for use in a criminal investigation into drugs trafficking, police said. Judge Marcel Maia Montalvao had in two previous instances issued fines against Facebook for refusing to release WhatsApp data, reports say. The information was needed as part \"secrete judicial investigations involving organised crime and drug trafficking,\" he has said. Meanwhile, in a statement Facebook called Mr Dzodan's arrest an \"extreme and disproportionate measure\" and \"Facebook has always been and will be available to address any questions Brazilian authorities may have,\" it added."}
