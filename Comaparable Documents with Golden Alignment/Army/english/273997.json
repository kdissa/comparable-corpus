A formal Guard Turnout and a Guard of Honour, presented by troops of the SFHQ - West to the Commander, SF-West on the anniversary day upon his arrival in the premises kicked off the day's proceedings before the day's Chief Guest joined a sapling-planting drive inside the SFHQ-West grounds at Panagoda. A customary troop address on the occasion plus award of T-shirts to All Ranks and members of the civil staff as a gift on the anniversary day brought the first segment of the anniversary event to a close. An all-night ‘Pirith’ chanting and offer of 'Heel Daana' to 15 monks got underway inside the office complex, prior to the anniversary day. Similarly, religious prayers of Catholic, Islamic and Hindu denominations in separate locations, including the Pannipitiya church, Galagedara mosque and the Hindu Kovil in Hanwella added blessings on the anniversary of the SFHQ-West. Officers, Other Ranks and Civil staffers were associated with those anniversary events. In connection with the event, a musical evening plus a get-together kicked off in the same evening."}
