Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, Commander of the Army gracing the inaugural phase at the new Army HQ as the Chief Guest flagged off the riding tour, amid cheers and best wishes. This project was initiated in order to build up morale, endurance, physical fitness, unity and co-operation among all sections of troops and mark the phenomenal re-location of the Army HQ in Sri Jayawardenepura. Hundreds of cycle fans in all under command units of the 53 Division joined the programme with enormous interest and courage under the guidelines given by Major General Jayashantha Gamage, General Officer Commanding, 53 Division. The cyclists will ride up to Maliboda and climb the Sri Paada upon the completion of the expedition to receive blessings and invoke blessings on the Army and the new HQ. Waving of the Army and the 53 Division Flags signalled the start of the expedition after arrival of the Commander of Army in the premises. Those riders will ride up to Kosgama, Deraniyagala and Maliboda by bicycles and proceed to the Sri Paada from there onward on foot."}
