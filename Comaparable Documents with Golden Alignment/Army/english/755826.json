The Vavuniya Cultural Hall which was used by the Armed Forces as a centre for coordination of civil affairs in Vavuniya before 2017 remained abandoned and dilapidated at the time the Security Force Headquarters - Wanni (SFHQ-W) came forward to renovate it and vest it back in the Vavuniya people as a symbol of gratitude. Accordingly, with the blessings of the Commander of the Army, CES troops undertook the renovation work on 27 August 2017 and work was carried out under the supervision of Major W.C Deshapriya, Officer Commanding of 22 CES squadron. Lieutenant Colonel H.B.C Mahendra, Commanding Officer, 22 CES offered guidance in this regard. The Army spent Rs 10 m for renovation of the entire building since it would serve a platform for cultural roles of Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims. During the simple ceremony, the keys of the renovated Cultural Hall were delivered to Mr I.M Hanifa, District Secretary for Vavuniya by Major General Kumudu Perera in the presence of Mr K Udayarasa, Divisional Secretary, District Secretariat officials, religious leaders and a gathering of community leaders."}
