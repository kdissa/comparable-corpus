A few days ago, a group of 10 RRC-trained disabled War Heroes on Hairdressing and Beauty culture on the guidelines given by Brigadier Thanika Perera, Commandant, RRC visited the Leprosy Hospital and shaved hair and beards of all 32 inmates (male and female) in the hospital, including some who had declined to vacate the Hospital since their relatives are reluctant to accept them home again after full cure. The RRC, which is exclusively designed to uplift physical, psychological and spiritual standards of disabled War Heroes in close coordination with the Sri Lanka Vocational Training Authority at present trains battlefield-wounded War Heroes in Motorbike and Three-wheel repairing, Aluminium industry, Carpentry, Electronics, Computer hardware, Hairdressing and Beauty culture, Software applications, Landscaping and Mobile phone repairing with the intention of tapping their inborn skills and expertise. Those War Heroes, prior to hairdressing and shaving of beards washed those inmates properly and shared a few thoughts with them and inquired into their most urgent needs. It was further revealed that the irrational social phobia towards Leprosy and this particular hospital in society has largely prevented their next of kin from taking them home after full recovery."}
