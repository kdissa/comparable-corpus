Members of the 88-Group during a recent visit to the Arali Point saw for themselves the need for an alternative power plant to the area and its resultant hardships largely being experienced by the troops serving there. In coordination with Colonel Asanga Perera, himself an old Royalist, the 88-Group sponsored the purchase of the solar system and delivered it to be installed in parallel with the re-opening of the renovated Arali Point War Heroes’ memorial. The Commanding Officer of the 17 GW detachment accepted the donation from the 551 Brigade Commander on Monday (10) to coincide with the re-opening of the renovated Arali Point monument."}
