Troops of the 3 Gajaba Regiment of the 574 Brigade under the 57 Division on the directions of Major General Vijitha Ravipriya, Commander, SF-KLN put up this large and long hall that could accommodate at least 4-5 classes under one roof as a temporary and immediate solution to the question of space. Troops also cemented the floor and made it neat and tidy under the supervision of the 574 Brigade Commander. During a simple ceremony on Tuesday (1) which also coincided with the World Children’s Day, Commander, 574 Brigade, Colonel I.A.N.B Perera cut a ribbon and vested the new structure with the students in front of the principal and teachers. At the same time, the day’s Chief Guest together with several Officers and Other Ranks who were present at the location joined hands with students to plant some saplings in the school compound with the intention of stimulating them for tree planting. The newly constructed temporary hut could also be used for various other purposes of the students. At the end of the event teachers and students extended their gratitude to the Army."}
