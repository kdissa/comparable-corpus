The new cafeteria of 70 ft in length is able to house 100 those physically-handicapped War Heroes at a time and furnished with most modern furniture and comfortable auxiliary equipment to match with varying degrees of their disability. The need for such a comfortable cafeteria was observed by the SLLI Colonel of the Regiment when he paid a visit to the SLLI Headquarter Battalion some time ago. However, with funds, generated by the Regimental Headquarters, SLLI Headquarters Battalion and with the sponsorship of several philanthropists, the construction was completed within a very short period. On Wednesday (8), a brief ceremony held at Boossa invited Major General Ruwan Kulathunga as the Chief Guest to vest the new cafeteria with those differently able SLLI War Heroes at the auspicious minute. Several SLLI Senior Officers, Colonel D.A.K Dissanayake, SLLI Centre Commandant, SLLI Headquarter Battalion Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel R.M.S Rajakaruna, donors for the project, SLLI Officers and Other Rankers were present during the opening ceremony."}
