Troops on the directions of the SF Commander and under the supervision of the General Officer Commanding, 11 Division joined other rescue teams and civilians who were engaged in search operations for missing children. However, civilians managed to find the missing boy alive but not the two girls. Inclement weather patterns with heavy rains and gushing winds have by now affected Sabaragamuwa Province, Southern and Central Provinces claiming a few lives and causing heavy damages to properties as water in several rivers have reached flood levels, compelling the opening of sluice gates. The dead body of one little girl was however recovered and handed over to the Police for onward proceedings. Meanwhile, troops immediately rushed to Ginigathhena town area affected by a landslide and recovered a dead body of a Muslim trader who had been buried inside rubble and soil after his shop was also caught in the landslide this morning (19)."}
