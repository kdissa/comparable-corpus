Award of those long overdue promotions, held up for some time due to non-availability of career opportunities within the establishment was made possible due to the intervention of HE the President through a special Cabinet paper following direct approach, made by Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, acting Chief of Defence Staff and Commander of the Army.
