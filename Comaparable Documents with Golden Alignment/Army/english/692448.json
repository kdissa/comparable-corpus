On being informed of the miserable plight of the 5th Grade Scholarship achiever who was the 3rd in the Wanni District, Colonel Anil Peiris, Colonel General Staff (Col GS) at the SFHQ-W explored possibilities of offering her family of a new house since the family was living in a house, made of wattle and daub, minus basic sanitary facilities. Accordingly, on an initiative of the same Col GS, Mr Chandana Alahakoon in the south came forward to sponsor the cost of the new house, needed for Ms R Niwarasana (11) and her family in Ganeshapuram, Vavuniya. 2 Mechanized Infantry Regiment (MIR) troops of the 211 Brigade on the instructions of Brigadier Kumara Jayapathirana, General Officer Commanding, 21 Division volunteered to erect the new house to the family using their technical expertise. Similarly, Engineer Asoka Weerasinghe and Dr Nandani Weerasinghe, learning about their economic constraints following coordination done by Brigadier Jayampathy Thilakaratne, General Officer Commanding, 61 Division awarded a scholarship to the student who excels in studies. Taking a leap further forward, after information confirmed that another helpless family, the Nagarasa Moorthy were living in a hut with the family in Pampaimadu, Vavuniya, the sameCol GS contacted Major (Retd) Shan Ferdinado who was generous enough to build a new house for this family considering their helpless situation. 25 Sri Lanka Light Infantry troops under the 621 Brigade with the supervision of Brigadier Dhammika Jayasinghe, General Officer Commanding, 62 Division constructed this new house in Pampaimadu. The formal warming of both houses plus handover to the beneficiaries took place on Wednesday (10) during two separate opening ceremonies, headed by Major General Kumudu Perera, Commander, Security Forces - Wanni. On the day of ceremonial openings, Brigadier Jayampathy Thilakarathne added further dignity to the occasion by providing 100 coconut saplings for planting in the area and offering a valuable electric tube well, worth about Rs 100,000/= to one of the families whose compound lacks drinking water. General Officers Commanding of 61 and 62 Divisions, Senior Officers representing Security Force Headquarters - Wanni, family members of beneficiaries and many villagers were present at the time of house warming ceremonies."}
