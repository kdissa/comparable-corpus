{"Header": "Hasalaka War Hero's Gallantry Remembered at Elephant Pass ", "Time": "15th July 2019 20:48:51 Hours", "Content": "Memories of one of the most remembered War Heroes in contemporary times, late 'Hasalaka Hero' alias Corporal Gamini Kularatne of 6 Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment (SLSR) who paid the supreme sacrifice on 14 July 1991 to prevent an enemy bulldozer ramming into the Elephant Pass Army garrison were recalled  at the monumental Gamini Kularatne’s memorial at Elephant Pass on account of his 28th death anniversary on Sunday (14). The commemorative event, organized by the 66 Division and the 662 Brigade on the guidelines given by Major General Vijitha Ravipriya, Commander, Security Forces - Kilinochchi (SF-KLN) included an all-night 'Pirith' chanting ceremony by the side of the Hasalaka War Hero’s memorial at Elephant Pass, followed by an alms-giving, the following  morning. Commander, Security Forces- Kilinochchi graced the event as the Chief Guest, together with late Corporal Kularatne’s mother, Mrs S.G Juliet and his family members. Brigadier Mangala Wijesundara, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 66 Division, Brigadier General Staff SF-KLN, Brigade Commanders of 661,662,663 Brigades and Commanding officers of under command battalions of the 66 Division were also associated with the commemorative event. After the GOC 66 Division received the chief guest, he was invited to light the eternal flame on the monument before both the National anthem and the Army song rent the air. A fitting two-minute silence remembered his memory and all fallen War Heroes.  Seconds later, together with the mother of the fallen War Hero, Major General Vijitha Ravipriya, GOC 66 Division and a few Senior Officers lined up and placed floral wreaths at the monument and paid their respect.  The formal Last Post was sounded, giving due honour to his memory as dusk enveloped the premises. A video documentary on the War Hero was then screened with active contribution given to the entire sequence of war hero's encounters against the enemy. Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment and the Regimental band of the Sri Lanka Engineers meticulously staged the commemorative event. This young soldier on that fateful day lobbed a grenade against the LTTE’s explosive-laden bulldozer which was attempting to ram the Elephant Pass Army Camp and bravely foiled the enemy’s attempt of entering into the camp. He blew up a grenade and laid his life preventing the LTTE attempt of forceful entry.In recognition of this act of supreme gallantry, late Corporal Kularatne was posthumously awarded the supreme decoration a soldier could earn, the Parama Weera Vibhushana (PWV) Medal. In 1990s, the Elephant Pass camp remained an important target for LTTE terrorists and a strategically sensitive area for control of the Jaffna peninsula. On that decisive night, over 5,000 LTTE terrorists surrounded the 600-strong Army garrison at Elephant Pass and were trying to take control of the camp by forcefully entering into it. As dusk fell, terrorists tried a new tactic, sending an armoured fighting vehicle, a converted Caterpillar bulldozer, to break the defence line. Heavy weapons mounted on the bulldozer hammered the defenders and LTTE terrorists slowly moved up along their demarcated path, smashing a bunker, and finally the bulldozer broke through the forward defence line. Hasalaka Gamini amidst heavy crossfires between the next line of defence and attacking Tigers kept on running until he reached the rear side of the oncoming armoured bulldozer and scaled its ladder. Hauling himself onto the armoured bulldozer, Corporal Kularatne used his grenades to kill the four-man crew inside, blowing up with inevitable explosions. Thus, the passage of the LTTE bulldozer further was abruptly stalled. Late Corporal Kularatne was found dead on the road by his comrades later on as the dawn fell after the fighting. Corporal Kularatne was born in 1966 as the second son of a family of four brothers and a sister. He obtained his primary education from Ranasinghe Premadasa Madhya Maha Vidyalaya, Hasalaka. He joined the Army in 1987 as a rifleman of the 6 Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment. The monument to Hasalaka War Hero was later set up at Elephant Pass with the remnants of the very bulldozer he destroyed after the war was over."}
