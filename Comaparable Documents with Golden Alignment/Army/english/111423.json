{"Header": "Cordial Discussions Lead to Recovery of Erstwhile Army Ward in Kandy Hospital", "Time": "02nd April 2019 15:46:46 Hours", "Content": "Cordial discussions that ensued between Dr Saman Rathnayake, Director, Kandy General Hospital and Major General Tissa Nanayakkara, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 11 Division resulted in the recovery of erstwhile Army Ward in the Kandy General Hospital which had been acquired by the hospital earlier for use of civil patients. The absence of this reserved Ward for Army personnel in this major hospital in the up country caused much inconvenience and embarrassment to the sick as they are compelled to receive treatment amidst different types of patients. Due to the understanding that was made after the necessity of re-acquisition of this premises was highlighted by the GOC, Dr Saman Rathnayake, Director got this Ward again reserved for Army personnel, effective from 28 March 2019. Paying gratitude to the Director, a representative group of officers on Monday (1) visited the acquired Ward and closely inspected it before commencement of its use."}
