CCC troops, alert to the short notice, greeted him to a Guard Turnout before he was enlightened on specific CCC assignments and tasks through a presentation, made by Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupura, Commanding Officer of the Sri Lankan CCC. Afterwards, the visiting Major General spoke to the CCC troops and thanked the troops. “This is my third and last visit to the Sri Lanka’s Combat Convoy Company. I came today to express my thanks and my respect to all the officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers of this robust, powerful and effective unit before my departure,” he had reportedly said. Before he bade farewell, he added memories to the visit by sitting together for a group photo and planting a sapling in the premises. A lunch treat brought the day’s event to end. Major General Jean - Paul Deconinck was accompanied by Brigadier General A.T.M Anisuzzaman and a few other Officers and members of the civil staff from Force Headquarters and the Sector East Headquarters."}
