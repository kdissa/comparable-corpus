Due to poor maintenance and extreme weather conditions experienced in the past few months, the road turned almost impassable with big potholes, etc. It was not fit for vehicles as well as for any walk on foot. However, with the blessings of the Commander, Security Forces - Wanni (SF-W) Major General Kumudu Perera, the General Officer Commanding, 6l Division Brigadier K.D.C.G.J Tilakarathne took initiatives to renovate the road by organizing a Shramadana campaign for two days (12 - 13 Dec), together with civilians. The road patch was completely restored and made motorable once again."}
