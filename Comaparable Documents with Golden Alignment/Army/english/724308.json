This will empower the use of gun computing applications to improve gunnery skills and increase efficiency of gun positions for accurate and guaranteed indirect fire targets. Handheld Ballistic Computer could also integrate different weapon types or capabilities in the same fire unit, in the same location and in the same fire mission to create unparalleled flexibility and provide simultaneously the capability to engage targets effectively with single weapon type or multiple weapon types. Sri Lanka Army expects to launch its envisioned plans to initiate the first step towards acquiring network-centric warfare capabilities by inducting this computerized command and control system to integrate its artillery weapon operations in future. Brigadier N.P Akuranthilake, Director RAP&D Branch, Brigadier M.P Karunaratne, Artillery Brigade Commander, Colonel S.D Udayasena, Principal Investigator of the project and Lieutenant Colonel C Tennakoon, Commandant, School of Artillery were present on this occasion."}
