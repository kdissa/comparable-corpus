Similarly, on the same day, following an initiative of the Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna, Major General Darshana Hettitarachchi, a voluntary signature collection drive for donation of human tissues upon death of the signatory kicked off. Accordingly, the SFHQ-J expects to collect as many as 10,000 Army personnel to give their consent for donation of human tissues posthumously to the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society, enabling it to collect bone chips, amniotic membranes, and skulls, etc when someone dies. More than 650 Army troops signed up forms with the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society on the same occasion and volunteered to donate their human tissues posthumously. SFHQ-J plans to get more than 10,000 signatures of Army personnel serving in the North to the noble project within a period of few months. According to the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society, organs such as bone chips, hip joints, skulls and different bones can be successfully transplanted and enable people to survive in the event of any such damage, caused due to accidents or otherwise. Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi, Commander, SF-J signed up the first form on the occasion and inaugurated the drive to collect volunteers to the project."}
