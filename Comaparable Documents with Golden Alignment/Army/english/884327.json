{"Header": "More Expatriates Come Forward to Sponsor Army Community Projects in Jaffna", "Time": "15th April 2019 20:57:46 Hours", "Content": "More and more expatriates, apparently impressed with the genuine and dedicated commitment of the Army to the welfare of low-income group families in the Jaffna peninsula, continue to extend their hands of friendship and understanding by way of constructing new houses and sanitary facilities, donation of household appliances and essentials and contribution of incentives for students under learning. In another mega such project Oman-based expatriates, Mr Mohan Shankar and Mrs Vadhani Shankar through bonds of goodwill they maintain with Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi, Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna (SF-J), spending a sum of Rs 3 million built 3 new houses with technical and engineering support given by Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna (SFHQ-J) troops after selecting 3 most deserving families in the general areas of Kodikamam and Chullipuram in Jaffna peninsula. 11 Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI), 7 Gajaba Regiment (GR) and 15 GR troops completed the project with enthusiasm on the guidelines given by Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi. All 3 families were selected in consultation with respective Grama Seva officials and senior citizens. Likewise, the same donors put up 10 new sanitary units for 10 poor families in the area after this vital need was brought to the notice of the Jaffna Commander. 1 Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR) troops of the Jaffna peninsula undertook the project and provided these needy families with these new toilet facilities. As the final leg of the mega project, Mr Mohan Shankar and Mrs Vadhani Shankar were generous enough to distribute 25 scholarships, each worth Rs 2500/= among needy school students after inviting them to the Security Force Headquarters auditorium in Palaly. Under this programme, each student studying in upper grades is to receive Rs 2500/= every month until they finish their university education. Delivery of keys to 3 new houses and formal vesting of new toilet facilities in poor families took place recently in Kalavani Community Centre where a large stock of household appliances and essentials were also given away. Those 3 new houses were constructed under the close supervision of General Officers Commanding in 51 and 52 Divisions with active coordination done by the SFHQ-J."}
