Major General Dushyantha Rajaguru, Commander Security Forces - Mullaittivu at the invitation of the 64 Division GOC unveiled a plaque and warmed the new auditorium where nearly 250 soldiers could be accommodated. Division also expects to lend it out for public functions and other purposes as a gesture of reconciliation and harmony since the public in the area are also without any such facility. A few years ago, the corner-stone for this need was laid but financial constraints prevented it becoming a reality until it was completed a few days back, following untiring efforts of the GOC, 64 Division. Senior Officers, officers and a large number of other ranks attended the opening event."}
