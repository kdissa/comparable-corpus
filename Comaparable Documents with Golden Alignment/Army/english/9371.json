Here is the full text of his speech; “After incidents occurred yesterday in the North Western Province specially starting from Chilaw went up to Kuliyapitiya, Hettipola and in that area, we had to impose curfew in the course of last evening, dark hours. There had been incidents where some youth were involved in damaging and destroying properties. So, I as Army Commander request here and the same time warn anyone who has planned to destroy or dishonor the orders given by the government or the Armed Forces, that we will take stern action, I say again we will take stern action to apprehend, arrest and even to fire and use minimum or maximum powers given under emergency. We will ensure that the country will not be getting back to a situation of violent activities and the violence in terms of radicalization and the terrorists. Please ensure that you do not get involved in such incidents or any activities which is not legal at all and the Armed Forces are not hesitant to use the power to curb and curtail and contain the situation. Armed Forces are powerful enough in this country to ensure there won’t be an escalation of violence in any part of the island. We have deployed the Army, Navy and Air Force in assistance to the Police to bring the law and order into a controlled situation. I humbly request the youth in the areas not to get involved in that and get entangled with the Armed Forces where we are ready to use our powers.”"}
