Prevailing adverse weather conditions and gushing flood waters washed away a patch of the road layer on the bridge, turning it risky for vehicular traffic for passage. Road Development Authorities after restricting heavy traffic flow along the route requested for Army help to restore normalcy for traffic. Reacting to the emergency need, Major General Ruwan Wanigasooriya, Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna accordingly directed those 10 Field Engineers to renovate the bridge immediately for the use of public. Accordingly, 16 Gemunu Watch troops under command to the 513 Brigade, responsible for the area supported 10 Field Engineers during this task. At present, the bridge has now been renovated and now open for traffic."}
