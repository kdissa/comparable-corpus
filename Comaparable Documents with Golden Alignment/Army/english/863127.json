We are indebted to the War Heroes for ever because they as the country's only beam of hope salvaged our country, and now rendering great service to the helpless. Your humanitarian initiative to provide shelter to us as living 'Gods' after the country was freed from terrorism, is remembered for ever, and that is why I am dropping tears of happiness,\" so said Mrs Damayanthi Kumari, the recipient of the new Army-built home who this morning (13) accepted the keys for her new 'dream' home with her two children in Inamaluwa Rotary Gama from the pioneer of the project, Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, Commander of the Army. After the Divisional Secretariat and the Grama Seva official in the area, having decided to explore possibilities of erecting a new shelter for this fatherless family, turned to the then General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 53 Division, Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva who readily undertook the challenge some time back and initiated the ground-breaking work with the cooperation of his friends, acquaintances and philanthropists in the area and elsewhere. Although the then GOC was afterwards elevated to serve as the Chief of Staff, and then as the Commander of the Army since August, this year, the project continued uninterrupted with the support of subsequent GOCs and the pioneer of the project, to-date. Sunday (13), being the most sacred 'Vap' Poya day, saw the pilot of the project, Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva as the day's Chief Guest arrives at Inamaluwa for the ceremonial handover and warming of the new house to the family of Mrs Damayanthi Kumari, the widowed mother of two children, both below 15 years of age. In the mid of 'Seth Pirith' chanting of the members of the Maha Sangha, the heavyweight behind its fruition, flanked by beneficiaries unveiled a plaque, cut a ribbon and warmed the completely furnished house by delivering the keys to the beneficiaries. The warming rites and rituals ensued as the attendees too flocked inside the new home. Built by the Corps of Engineer Service troops in the 53 Division and teams under command to the 53 Division, the new house cost about Rs 7 million when it was completed with furniture and other kitchen accessories. The day's Chief Guest, Commander of the Army was welcomed by Major General Jayashantha Gamage, General Officer Commanding 53 Division and beneficiaries on arrival in the Rotary Gama Inamaluwa, together with Officers and those who constructed the new home. With financial and material donations of various philanthropists, the construction proper got to a start exactly a year ago on 14 October 2018 when Major General Athula Kodippili, currently the Adjutant General commanded the 53 Division on the guidelines given by the Commander of the Army. Donors, Major General Athula Kodippili, Adjutant General, Major General Jayashantha Gamage GOC, 53 Division, State Officials and well-wishers were present during the simple warming ceremony."}
