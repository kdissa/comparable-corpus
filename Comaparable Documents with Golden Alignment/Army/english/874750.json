The day’s event got to a start in the presence of a large gathering of Officers and Other Ranks after the SLA Centre Commandant welcomed both of them on arrival. As has been the tradition, they paid floral tributes to the memory of fallen SLA War Heroes at first and then reviewed the Guard Turnout, presented by the Regimental Headquarters troops and accepted the Regimental salute accorded in a Guard of Honour parade. Memories were added afterwards when all Officers present sat together with the day's protagonists for a photograph. The day’s proceedings culminated with an All Rank lunch at the   6 Sri Lanka Artillery Headquarters in the noon."}
