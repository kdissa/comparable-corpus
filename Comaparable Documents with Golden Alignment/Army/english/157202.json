It all happened soon after the soldiers on duty at that roadblock conducted a check on the NB 9742 passenger bus bound for Kalmunai from Mannar on Wednesday (5). The said Staff Sergeant as he stepped out after the checking of the bus spotted a wallet lying in ground where the bus was screened for security purposes. He immediately picked it and handed over the wallet to his Commanding Officer in the 18 SLNG ‘C’ group who was in charge of the soldiers on duty. However, information available inside the wallet revealed that it belonged to one Ms Arumugam Krishnadevi of No 286, Thiruwalluwar, Periya Nilawan, Batticaloa. Later on, the Commanding Officer of the 18 SLNG after praising the Staff Sergeant traced the owner in coordination with Security Force Headquarters – East troops in Batticaloa. The wallet with valuables was returned to the owner by the Staff Sergeant W.A Priyantha Kumara after inviting her to the same location in the presence of several other Officers and Other Rankers."}
