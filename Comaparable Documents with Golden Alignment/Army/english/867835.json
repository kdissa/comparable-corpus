On being informed of the tragic incident, the 55 Division GOC with his troops rushed to the location and found the family had been rendered homeless and were helpless without a shelter of any kind for them to live in. Brigadier Kotuwegoda promptly jumped into action and instructed his troops to put up a temporary shelter for the family at their expense after collecting some tin sheets without any delay. More than 20 Army troops participated in this humanitarian project. Within a few hours, troops erected the temporary house for them with raw materials, provided by the Army and made them safe with two children. A few minutes later, the family was also provided with most essentials and troops took necessary measures to keep the state officials in the respective area informed in order for them to receive further assistance."}
