{"Header": "55 Division Troops Make Road Motorable After Urgent Repairs", "Time": "11th January 2020 09:30:08 Hours", "Content": "Following an initiative of the 55 Division, 23 Gemunu Watch (GW) and 12 Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR) troops of the 552 Brigade completed the repairs of about 10 km distance along the Iyyakachchi junction to Kaddeikadu road patch after a request to that effect was referred to the Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna. A group of about 40 troops using own heavy machinery, backhoes and other equipment patched up those potholes and repaired damaged spots using metal and soil within the course of a full day. Due to recent monsoon rains and adverse weather conditions, the said road patch was badly damaged and became hardly motorable as a result of potholes and muddy spots. People in the area remained badly affected since it was the same road that runs to famous Vettelakerni Kovil (Temple) which draws large numbers of devotees on a daily basis. At a short notice, Major General Sampath Kotuwegoda, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 55 Division with the blessings of Major General Ruwan Wanigasooriya, Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna undertook the repair work since it has hampered the public transport too, disrupting day-today public life in the area."}
