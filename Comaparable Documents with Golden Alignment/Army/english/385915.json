It was held with the participation of the OCDC Commandant, Major General Jayanath Jayaweera and members of the permanent staff. Major Nandana Senevirathna, a member of the Directing Staff conducted the cultural session in combination with traditional dancing features presented by a group of Gemunu Watch troops. Major Nandana presented the session with historical facts and the roots of those traditional dance patterns. A 13-member dancing team performed ‘Thelme’ dance which is performed for Dolos Deviyan (Twelve Gods), ‘Asne’ dance which is one of the main ‘Kohomba Kankariya’ devil dances, and a low-country dance called ‘Naga Raksha’ (Cobra Mask). The picturesque evening finally culminated with a display of the ensemble of drummers."}
