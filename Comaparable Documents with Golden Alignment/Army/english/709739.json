No matter what religion you in the Army believe but we all stand together as members of one Sri Lanka and also as Sri Lankans, despite your religious beliefs,” Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, Commander of the Army quipped when media personnel sought his comments on arrangements, related to the Army commemoration during interactions with them at the Kollupitiya Jummah Mosque premises this morning (3). “That is why we select major sacred places of worship, temples, Kovils, mosques and churches to invoke blessings on the organization as well as transfer merits to all War Heroes killed in action while blessing the injured for speedy recovery. The Army deeply respects every religion and all have the full freedom to follow religions of their wish inside the organization. We as a small country have to join hands together as Sri Lankans, and then only we would be able to reach our goals. The Army belongs to all ethnicities in this country and we will have to march forward as a united nation and Sri Lankans because only that would form our unity and strength,” the Commander of the Army opined. Earlier, during Islamic prayers, Imam Moulavi, Salaman Izadeen in his ‘Bayan’ oration to the occasion strongly declared that Prophet Mohammed had asserted that a true Muslim man (Musalmani) would never ever try to take someone else’s life for any reason and that is where a Muslim is different from others."}
