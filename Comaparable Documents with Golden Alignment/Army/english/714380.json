Documents belonging to those buildings and surrounding lands that were acquired by the troops during the war for peace were thus delivered to Kilinochchi District Secretary, Mr. S Arumenayaham by Major General Vijitha Ravipriya, Commander, Security Forces - Kilinochchi after visiting the office of the District Secretary. This measure is another initiative taken by the Sri Lanka Army to expedite the process of releasing lands belonging to the private and the state sector to be in keeping with the state policy which would expedite the resettlement programmes as a matter of priority.
