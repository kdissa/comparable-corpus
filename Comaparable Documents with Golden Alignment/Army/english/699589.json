Unexpected cyclonic weather conditions that swept across during small hours on Wednesday (11) prompted 142 Brigade troops to jump into action in several city areas in the south and south east of Colombo. Troops were compelled to clear fallen trees, posts, fronds, tree branches, etc which disrupted traffic and movement of the pedestrians. On Thursday (12), troops assisted affected civilians to re-thatch their roofs and clear compounds. Sri Lanka Light Infantry troops and Corps of Engineer Services troops volunteered their services."}
