The people are engaged with keen enthusiasm for the New Year season.Â  The sale and purchase of goods are reported to be taking place than in the ordinary days. In such a situation it is found that there is a breach of rights of the consumers. Taking this situation into consideration a special programme has been launched to protect the rights of the consumers. Accordingly daily inspections are being carried out in shops and hotels. The main purpose of this programme is to ensure that the people get healthy food and consumer items during this festive season. The Consumer Affairs Authority said that the law will be strictly enforced against traders selling expired food items. In the meantime an inspection of shops and hotels in the Jaela town had been carried out. In this process legal action has been initiated against several shops that had sold unhygienic shops unsuitable for consumption. The Consumer Affairs Authority said that such search operations are being planned within the next few days. Public Health Inspector K.A. Anura Abeyratne said that they are carrying out these raids on the sidelines of the festive season. They are taking action to seize unhygienic food and institute legal action against those responsible."}
