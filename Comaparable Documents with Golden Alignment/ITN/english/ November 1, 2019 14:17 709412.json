Cameron and David Ellison are the film’s producers. In 2020, a cybernetically-enhanced soldier, Grace, and an advanced Terminator model, the Rev-9, are separately transported from the future to Mexico City; both with Daniella “Dani” Ramos in their sights. The Terminator infiltrates the factory where Dani and her brother Diego work to kill the former, but is thwarted by Grace, who escapes with the siblings. The Rev-9 pursues them, utilizing its ability to split itself into its powerful endoskeleton and shapeshifting liquid metal exterior to kill Diego and corner Grace and Dani. However, Sarah arrives and temporarily disables the Terminator with explosives. The film is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States today."}
