The Ministry of Agriculture has pointed out that there is a high demand in the market for paddy produced sans using chemical fertilizer. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera presided the discussion held for Matara District officials to educate them on the national operation “We Eat What We Produce” which has been launched by the Ministry of Agriculture. The meeting also discussed the programme crafted on the contribution that could be made by the agricultural sector for the development of the country by the year 2020. Farmers who are cultivating two hectares or less paddy lands are entitled to receive the organic fertilizer subsidy. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera announced at this meeting that it is mandatory for the farmer community to register themselves with the Strategic Enterprises Management Institute for this purpose. In the meantime, the purchase of the Yala paddy harvest in the Hambnthota District has commenced. All Paddy Warehouses in the District are kept open to purchase paddy.
