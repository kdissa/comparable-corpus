The levels of the pollutant PM2.5 was at a “severe” 644 or over 20 times the safe limit prescribed by the WHO this morning at south Delhi’s Okhla. PM2.5 are fine particles that can penetrate the lungs and cause respiratory diseases. Visibility on the roads was low this morning, as against yesterday when air quality significantly improved due to increased wind speed and control measures implemented by the government. Smog kills more than one million Indians every year and Delhi has the worst air of any major city on the planet."}
