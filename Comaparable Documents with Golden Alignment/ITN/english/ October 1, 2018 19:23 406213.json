Thereafter at the Prize Giving the President presented awards and certificates to students who displayed their skills. Further expressing his views at the prize giving President Maithripala Sirisena said that everyone should be dedicated to grooming an intellectual and virtuous child. The President said that he launched a special project at the Presidential Secretariat “Let us Protect the Children.” The results of all Projects launched should be passed on to the children. More attention should be directed from the school child to the undergraduate to protect from narcotics. As such the President said that attention should be directed to the challenges confronted by the children. The challenge may be faced by the child in the school or may be at home or at the bus stand or in public transport. The President said that more attention should be drawn to them at every such place."}
