Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of billionaire businessman Elon Musk, runs Big Green, a non-profit that builds gardens in low-income schools across America. It has installed 500 of them in six U.S. cities over the past six years. Big Green comes up with ways to tie the outdoor learning garden into the schoolâ€™s curriculum so that the students are using the garden all the time as an outdoor classroom. Welby Community School is one of the participating schools.
