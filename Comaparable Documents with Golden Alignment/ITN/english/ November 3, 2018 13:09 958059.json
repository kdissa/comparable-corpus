Xi welcomed Khan for paying an official visit to China and attending the first China International Import Expo. He hailed the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership as a special friendship shaped and developed during a long time of mutual support and close cooperation. Xi said the bilateral ties always stay vigorous and continue developing regardless of the changes in international situations or the two countries’ domestic affairs. China-Pakistan cooperation not only benefits both peoples but also contributes to regional and world peace, stability and development, Xi said. Xi appreciated Khan for repeatedly stressing that he would view the relations with China as a political cornerstone in Pakistan’s foreign policy and would unswervingly promote the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Xi said China always views relations with Pakistan as a priority of diplomacy and supports Pakistan in safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity."}
