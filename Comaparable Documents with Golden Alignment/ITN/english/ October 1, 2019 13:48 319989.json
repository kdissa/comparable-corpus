Heavy rains have killed at least 113 people in India’s Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states over the past three days. The National Disaster Response Force said about 3,000-4,000 people had been rescued and 19 teams were working around the clock to help people and deliver aid packages. In northern Uttar Pradesh’s Balia district, nearly 900 inmates were evacuated from a district prison and transported to neighbouring Azamgarh jail."}
