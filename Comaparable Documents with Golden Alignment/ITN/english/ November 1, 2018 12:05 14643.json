The Andean condor or Vultur gryphus, is often considered the largest flying bird in the world and is classified as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, meaning it is likely to become endangered in the near future. Locals in both the Neuquen and Mendoza provinces alerted police after they discovered dead and ill condors in the areas. On Tuesday (October 30) specialists came upon condors struggling to fly as they apparently suffered the effects of a poisoning. Ranchers have been known to bate local predators like wild dogs and mountain lions with poisoned cows or sheep. The predators die after eating the poisoned animals and the carcasses remain attracting scavengers including condors who also die from consuming the tainted meat. The practice is illegal and can land offenders in jail. Dead birds of prey, cats, dogs and cattle were found near where the condors were discovered."}
