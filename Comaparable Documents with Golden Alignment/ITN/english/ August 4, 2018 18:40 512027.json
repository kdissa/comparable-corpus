The Venerable Maligatenne Pannarathana Thera said that many problems arose at the commencement of the constructions. Although the laying of concrete has been completed, many cracks can be seen on the surface. People in the area charged that the contractor tried to cover up the cracks by laying cement over the cracks.  They say that although the government spend huge amounts on development work, proper use cannot be expected from those due to such acts."}
