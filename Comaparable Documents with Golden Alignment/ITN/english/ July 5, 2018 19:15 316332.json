GDE Bertoni, located in a small Italian town about 30 minutes outside Milan, has dozens of years of experience making trophies and medals for the world’s top football matches, including manufacturing the prized World Cup trophy.The World Cup trophies made by the company are actually gold-plated replicas of the original gold trophy which is owned by the International Federation of Football Association (FIFA). The original stands 36.8 centimeters high and weighs nearly 6.2 kilograms. Pietro, a metal crafter at the company, made the World Cup trophy won by the French team in 1998. He said it’s a great honor for him to be able to make the Word Cup trophies, which are all pieces of art in his eyes. Italy’s national football team did not qualify to compete in the 2018 World Cup, a huge disappointment for Italian fans, including the employees who make the coveted trophy. But they’re hopeful that Italy will make it to the next tournament."}
