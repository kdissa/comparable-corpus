A Malaysian court sentenced Doan Thi Huong to three years and four months in jail, starting from her arrest in February 2017. However, under Malaysian law she could be freed by May. Ms Huong would have faced the death penalty if found guilty of the murder. Mr Kim, the estranged half-brother of Kim Jong-un, was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur Airport in 2017 in broad daylight, with the toxic nerve agent VX."}
