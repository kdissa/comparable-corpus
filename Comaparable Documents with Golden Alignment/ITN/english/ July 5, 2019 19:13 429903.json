The President expressed this view at a function held at the Kaudulla Maha Vidyalaya. The new two storied classroom building of the school was declared open by the President. A sum of about five million rupees has been spent on the project under the Rajarata Navodaya Presidentâ€™s programme and the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa project. The labour contribution for this building came from the Air Force. Addressing the function that followed the opening of the building President Maithripala Sirisena said that a virtuous country and a good generation can be groomed when the temple, the school and the village unite. There are many developed countries in the world. They are developed only in physical resources. But the people of those countries are not good such as the people of this country. During the last five years no funds such as the present Government had spent on education. The President called on the children to study well and lead a better life in this competitive world and honour and respect their parents and teachers. North Central Governor Sarath Ekanayake was among the large gathering present."}
