The gala or Chunwan in Chinese, was first broadcast in 1983 and has since become a national tradition on the Lunar New Year Eve. This year’s gala featured 32 programs, including song and dance numbers, cross talks and short sketches, acrobatics, magic, Chinese opera, and other innovative performances such as a water ballet. At the same time cities of China were lit up with light shows and luminous decorations in celebration of the Spring Festival. Colorful lights illuminated skyscrapers along the Minjiang River and the Aofeng Bridge in east China’s Fujian Province. The lighting decorations displayed the warm and festive mood in Fuzhou City, Fujian’s provincial capital, extending warm wishes and festive greetings. The city of Tengzhou in eastern Shandong Province was radiant as traditional lanterns in different shapes such as dragons and pigs."}
