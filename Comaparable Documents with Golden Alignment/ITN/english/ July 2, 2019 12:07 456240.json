Activists occupied the Legislative Council for hours after breaking away from a peaceful protest. The unrest follows peaceful protests sparked by a divisive extradition bill. The chief executive held a pre-dawn press conference after police had fired tear gas to clear LegCo. The government suspended the extradition bill last month and it is now unlikely to pass, but the protesters want it scrapped completely and are calling on Ms Lam to stand down."}
