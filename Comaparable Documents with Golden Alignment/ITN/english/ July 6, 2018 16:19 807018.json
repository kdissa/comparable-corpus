The northern white rhino is the world’s most endangered mammal, and its only two living members are a mother and daughter, living in Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy. Scientists did, however, manage to collect around 300 millilitres of semen from the last four bull rhinos, which they say is a large quantity, albeit too low-quality for insemination. Having used some of this to fertilise eggs in vitro from the closest relative the southern white rhino they hope to use the same techniques to create an embryo of a pure northern white rhino with eggs harvested from the two females."}
