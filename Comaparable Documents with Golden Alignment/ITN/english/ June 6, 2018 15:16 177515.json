Villages on the slopes were buried in volcanic ash and mud. Rescue work was disrupted when a new eruption sent hot gas and molten rock streaming down the volcano’s south side. More than 1.7 million people have been affected by eruption, with more than 3,000 evacuated. Explosion took many by surprise after volcanologists said the eruption, which had sent ash up to 10km into the sky, was over for the near future. Meanwhile, A river of lava spewing from the foot of Hawaii’s Kilauea Volcano swallowed about three dozen more homes on the Big Island during a weekend of destruction that brought to nearly 120 the number of dwellings devoured since last month. Mounting property losses were reported a day after five or six people who initially chose to stay in the newly evacuated Kapoho area after road access was cut off were rescued by helicopter."}
