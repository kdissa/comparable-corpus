Conditions could not have been better for spectators and sailors alike, as the fleet reveled in 20 knots of breeze coming off the land on a beautiful autumn afternoon. After a very conservative start with no one wanting to be over the line early at the beginning of a 3,542-nautical mile course, the fastest boats quickly opened up the throttle. At the front of the fleet the ULTIME trimarans, led by Seb Josse on Maxi Solo Edmond de Rothschild, were hitting 30 knots of boat speed."}
