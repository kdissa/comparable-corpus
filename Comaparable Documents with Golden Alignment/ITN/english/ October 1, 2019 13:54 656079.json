Similar claims by the two men prompted an election crisis after the last presidential poll five years ago. Afghanistan’s Independent Election Commission is gathering votes from Saturday’s election. If no candidate wins more than half, a runoff vote would be held between the top two. Meanwhile, Amrullah Saleh, the running mate of the incumbent Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, said that Ghani had won a clear victory in the country’s Presidential elections. Preliminary results are not expected before Oct. 19 and final results not until Nov. 7."}
