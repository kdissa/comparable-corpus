The traditional face off was abandoned for fear of a repeat of the brawl that occured at the pairâ€™s joint news conference two days earlier. Fury weighed in at a 256.5 pounds (116.4 kilograms), a full 44 and a half pounds more than his American opponent who tipped the scales at 212 pounds (96.1 kgs). Wilder took the stage wearing an ominious black face mask which appeared to produce more laughs than alarm at the outdoor stage adjacent to the Staples Center where the fight will be held."}
