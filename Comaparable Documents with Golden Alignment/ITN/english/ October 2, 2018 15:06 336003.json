The event included military displays and a musical performance by South Korean rapper, Psy. This was a clear contrast to last year’s ceremony, which included a military parade and a showcasing of ballistic missiles. The announcement comes the same day as troops from North and South Korea began removing some landmines along their heavily fortified border in a pact to reduce tension and build trust on the divided peninsula."}
