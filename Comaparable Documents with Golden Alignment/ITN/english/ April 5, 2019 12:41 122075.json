One police commander told the TV Globo network that the criminal group was “prepared for war” and, aside from arriving in five armoured cars, were armed with high-calibre rifles and body armour.Police arrived at the banks and confronted the assailants, who fled and led police on a rolling shootout through the city of Guararema, located about 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of central metropolitan Sao Paulo.The suspects broke into a home at one point and held resident hostage, “but police managed to free them” the note from the secretariat read, without providing more details."}
