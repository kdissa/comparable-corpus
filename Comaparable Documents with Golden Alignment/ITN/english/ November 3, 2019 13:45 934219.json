Serbia’s world number one, who will be supplanted by Nadal at top of the ATP rankings, won a high-octane first-set tiebreak before wearing Dimitrov down in the second set. Djokovic will face Canada’s Denis Shapovalov in Sunday’s showpiece at Bercy after 19-time Grand Slam champion Nadal, who would have secured the year-end number one spot with the title here, withdrew minutes before his semi-final match. Top seed Djokovic, who has lifted the trophy here four times and will feature in his 50th Masters final, played better in the key moments and served well throughout."}
