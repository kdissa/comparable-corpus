The Senate, run by the presidentâ€™s fellow Republicans, voted to acquit him 52-48 on charges of abuse of power and 53-47 on obstruction of Congress. Democrats charged Trump in December with pressuring Ukraine to smear a potential White House rival. In November, Trump will be the first impeached president to go for election."}
