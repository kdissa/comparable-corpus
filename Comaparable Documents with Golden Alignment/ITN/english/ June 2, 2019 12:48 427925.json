Some Indian officials said India would take countermeasures, and might impose higher tariffs on more than 20 kinds of commodities imported from the United States. In early March, the U.S. Trade Representativeâ€™s office announced that the United States intends to move India and Turkey out of a program under which a group of developing countries receive preferential trade treatment. The program, called the Generalized System of Preferences, was created to support developing countries alleviating poverty through trade. India was designated as a beneficiary developing country under the program in a presidential executive order in November 1975."}
