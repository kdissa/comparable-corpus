And yet, on August 15, against all odds, a healthy baby girl was born by cesarean section weighing 2.13 kg and measuring 42 cm to her brain-dead mother. The success of the delivery would not have been possible without the support of the child’s family. Ventruba added that the girl was now in the care of her father, grandmother, and aunt."}
