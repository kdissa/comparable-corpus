Chandrasena has said that those who do not have land deeds will be given deeds within six months. He expressed this view joining in a programme held in the Kebethigollewa area in Anuradhapura. Minister S.M. Chandrasena pointed out that the President has been very practical in allocating the subjects of the ministries. The Minister stated that in the previous system, operations of forest conservation, wildlife conservation and surveying were carried out separately.Â  As a result the whole structure was ineffective and time consuming. The Minister pointed out as all those operations have now been conjoined, they will be able to issue the due land deeds within six months. He also expressed views regarding the arrest of former Minister Rajitha Senaratne in connection with the white van news briefing. The Minister pointed out that instead of secondary suspects of the controversial White Van media briefing are still in remand custody, the main perpetrator had been granted bail. The Minister noted that another mechanism will soon be introduced to effectively tackle bribery and corruption, in addition to the existing Commission."}
