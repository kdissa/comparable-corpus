Federer has been far from his ruthless best in the previous rounds but looked a different player in the last-four tie, as he broke his Croatian opponent four times and needed only 67 minutes to advance the final at the Aviation Club to be held this evening.The 20-times Grand Slam champion will now look to avenge his shock defeat by the 20-year-old Tsitsipas in the Australian Open fourth round in January. Victory for the Swiss, a seven-times winner in Dubai, will make him only the second man in the Open Era to win 100 titles after American great Jimmy Connors who has 109."}
