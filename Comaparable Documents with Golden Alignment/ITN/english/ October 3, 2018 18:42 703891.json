The Media Unit also requests the Media Organizations who reported the incident irresponsibly to refrain from such bad journalism. Some media outlets brought a news item that a family at the Galenbindunu weva area in Anuradhapura has consumed moringa leaves due to their poverty for many days. While paying special attention on the incident the President ordered to appoint a special committee to inquire the plight of the said people. As per the findings of the committee, the media outlets have given hype to the incident without divulging into the facts. According to the investigations done by the committee members the said family is not that poor like eating moringa leaves for few days. The committee had also inquired from the district Secretariat, Divisional Secretariat, Agrarian Department and several other organizations. It is revealed that the media organizations had exaggerated the situation. The committee had also recorded statements from the various officials including Grama Niladhari,Development Officers and Agricultural officers."}
