The Archbishop of Colombo expressed this view at a function held at St. Peter’s College in Colombo. The opening of the new Sports Pavilion of St. Peter’s College in Colombo-04 took place under the patronage of Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith. It has been named after Rev. Fr. Joe Wickramasinghe who served as the Principal of St. Peter’s College from the year 1977 to 1994. The new Sports Pavilion has a seating capacity of 2700 and the expenditure incurred was 200 million rupees. Among those present on the occasion was a group including Principal Fr. Trevor Martin. Addressing the function, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said that today he wished to express his special thanks to the Sri Lankan Government, Prime Minister RanilWickremasinghe and Minister AkilaVirajKariyawasaam for the decision taken for Private Schools to establish branch schools. He said this was a noble decision. When talking about education in Sri Lanka, it is a foolish thing to instill an outdated strategy in the country. A student will become a fully-fledged child if spiritual education is imparted to them and thereby become a proud person to Sri Lanka."}
