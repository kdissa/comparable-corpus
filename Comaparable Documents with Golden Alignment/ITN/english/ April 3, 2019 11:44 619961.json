Each of the past two weeks has registered a record number of new cases, marking a sharp setback for efforts to respond to the second biggest outbreak ever, as militia violence and community resistance have impeded access to affected areas. Less than three weeks ago, the WHO said the outbreak of the haemorrhagic fever was largely contained and could be stopped by September. Meanwhile, WHO said that 1,052 confirmed cases of cholera and 2,700 cases of acute diarrhoea have been reported in Mozambique. The World Health Organization’s spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, said 900,000 doses of oral cholera vaccine were expected to arrive and the campaign is expecting to start the next day. Cyclone Idai smashed into Beira on March 14, causing catastrophic flooding and killing more than 700 people across three countries in southeast Africa."}
