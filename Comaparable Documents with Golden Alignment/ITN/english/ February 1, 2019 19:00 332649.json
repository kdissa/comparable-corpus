The Prime Minister handed over land deeds to many state establishments which had so far not possessed these deeds. These include the Police, schools and hospitals. Prime Minister RanilWickremasinghe said that when many receive money or lands, they do not possess deeds. Sometimes if the officer decides to evict them they have to go. As such their main obligation is to provide title deeds to the farmers who had made the country self-sufficient in rice. The secondÂ  stage is to enact regulations to convert them into permanent deeds. When the Speaker signs this law, more than ten thousand will receive permanent deeds.
