Earlier on Friday, the two sides also sealed more than $5 billion deal according to which India will buy S-400 surface to air missile systems giving its military the ability to shoot down aircraft and missiles at unprecedented ranges.For all the warm words, ties with Moscow are a lot less central to Delhi than they were during the Cold War years, as India has diversified arms purchases, closing $15 billion of deals with the United States over the last decade."}
