In the Shanghai Ballet production of the Tchaikovsky classic, a total of 48 swans pirouette, arabesque and plie in unison, which is double the number of the usual 24. According to British choreographer Derek Deane, who cooperated with the Shanghai Ballet for the performances, the large number of dancers requires extra rehearsal time and coordination. The production features more than 100 dancers in total, as well as hundreds of costumes and elaborate scenery."}
