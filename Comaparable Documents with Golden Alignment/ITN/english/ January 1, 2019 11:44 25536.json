The home favourite took the first set on a tie-break, before failing to capitalise on a match point in the second set tiebreak. Sandgren levelled the match before receiving a code violation for delaying the match after a toilet visit at the end of the set. The American then failed to win another game as Millman took the third set 6-0, to secure a second round spot. He will take on former world number three Grigor Dimitrov."}
