Geert Cappelaere, Middle East director for the U.N. Childrenâ€™s Fund said children are dying from starvation and disease as trucks with life-saving supplies are blocked in port. Cappelaere recently met with families in Hodeidah and Saana where many of them are suffering due to lack of drinking water, fruit and vegetables. Already 1.8 million Yemeni children are malnourished, more than 400,000 of them suffering from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening condition that leaves them skeletal with muscle wasting."}
