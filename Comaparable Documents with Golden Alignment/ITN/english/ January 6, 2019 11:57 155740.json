Although Thai authorities reopened several airports in the affected regions, including Samui Airport, after Pabuk moved into the Andaman Sea on Friday, a subsequent downpour on Saturday morning led to massive flight delays at Samui Airport. The airport authority estimated that up to a thousand of tourists had been affected. Seven Chinese tourists said that their flight had been delayed for over four hours and they were still unsure when a rescheduled flight would be available. The airport’s information boards showed that only one of the three China-bound flights will depart on time, with the other two canceled and delayed respectively."}
