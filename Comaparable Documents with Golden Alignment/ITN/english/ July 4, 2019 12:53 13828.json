The hosts are set to finish third in the group and will meet India or Australia at Edgbaston next Thursday for a place in the final.Needing to defeat the Black Caps to be sure of progressing, England were led by Jonny Bairstow’s dominant hundred, his second century in the space of four days. Though they were checked as the New Zealand bowling improved, the England total of 305-8 seemed imposing on a pitch that gradually got harder to bat on.And they were boosted by the run outs of both Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor – Williamson unluckily undone when backing-up – that left New Zealand 69-4."}
