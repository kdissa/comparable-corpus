President Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling AK Party and its nationalist MHP allies hold a majority in parliament, said last week Turkey would deploy troops in Libya to support Fayez al-Serraj’s internationally-recognised Government of National Accord. The GNA last month requested Turkish support as it fends off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar’s forces to the east of the country, which are backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan."}
