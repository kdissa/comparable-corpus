The Briton’s morning lap of one minute 17.233 seconds was still the day’s best, with Gasly producing a 1:17.854 effort on the fastest soft tyres in the afternoon when the track was still suitable for slicks.Toro Rosso’s Alexander Albon crashed soon after the first spots of rain, the Thai acknowledging driver error after going onto the grass at the last corner.The incident brought out the red flags briefly.Hamilton’s Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas had to sit out the opening session while his mechanics changed the car’s power unit but returned after lunch to post the fourth fastest lap."}
