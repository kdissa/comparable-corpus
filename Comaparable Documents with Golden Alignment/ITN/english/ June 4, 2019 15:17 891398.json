His 6-3 6-2 6-2 defeat of the 45th-ranked German means Djokovic is the first man to reach 10 successive quarter-finals at Roland Garros a feat even Rafael Nadal has not achieved. He will face either Italian Fabio Fognini or German’s Alexander Zverev in the quarter-final. Djokovic is bidding to become only the second man to hold all four Grand Slams simultaneously twice, having first achieved the feat three years ago when he won his only French Open title. Also through to the quarter finals is Kei Nishikori, who extinguished the hot-headed Benoit Paire’s fiery challenge with an error-strewn 6-2 6-7(8) 6-2 6-7(8) 7-5 victory."}
