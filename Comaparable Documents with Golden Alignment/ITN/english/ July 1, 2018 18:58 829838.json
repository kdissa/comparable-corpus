There is a history of over 100 years for the local cashew trade. In the past many investors in the Cashew trade and the industry developed as a result. As the Cashew trade was mainly conducted at Bataleey village on Colombo – Kandy main road, many started to identify it as Kadju Gama. Women in Kadju Gama became popular in the 80’s decade due to the patronage received by Kadju Gama from late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The trade at Kadju Gama has decreased today due to various reasons. Traders say they can develop the industry if they were given loans. The government did not consider them as low income recipients and to provide them with relief. But the government launched programs such as Enterprise Sri Lanka to encourage investors. It has opened a separate window at the bank to encourage entrepreneurs as it is a timely need. Another program, Gamperaliya has been launched to further strengthen such government endeavors."}
