Vijitha Herath also expressed his views regarding the leasing of a land in Colombo to a Singaporean company. JVP propaganda secretary Vijitha Herath said that a Cabinet paper had been submitted last week by the Prime Minister regarding this agreement with a Singaporean company. The Secretary pointed out that the Cabinet paper clearly states that that a land near the Beire Lake will be leased to the Real State Company for 43 Million US Dollars, under a 250 Million US Dollar worth project. The JVP propaganda secretary highlighted that this clearly is committing Sri Lankan lands to foreign nations. Minister Wimal Weerawansa refuted all allegations which interpret the action as a sale. The Minister made this statement speaking to the media after a function held in Colombo today. Minister Wimal Weerawansa highlighted that this is no selling or exploitation of state lands. He said that this is joint business venture the Sri Lankan government has entered along with a Singaporean company, to build an apartment scheme. The Minister pointed out that the purchasers will be the actual owners of the apartments of the proposed flat."}
