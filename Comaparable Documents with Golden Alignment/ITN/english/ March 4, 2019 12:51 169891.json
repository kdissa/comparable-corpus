{"Header": "Baristas behind bars: UK prisoners swap crime for coffee", "Time": " March 4, 2019 12:51 ", "Content": "Every morning, the whirr of an industrial-scale coffee roaster and the sharp hiss of a milk frother can be heard as customers queue to get their caffeine fix at a most unusual spot: inside one of Britainâ€™s toughest young offenders prisons.Staffed by prisoners aged 18 to 21, the Redemption Roasters cafe inside Aylesbury prison, about 60 miles northwest of London, trains inmates with speciality coffee skills in a bid to help them to find jobs upon release. The small-scale coffee company is part of a growing number of businesses globally that aim to have a positive social impact while turning a profit. For 20-year-old Vince, whose real name could not be used, being productive and learning new skills instead of sitting idly in a cell means his years in jail have not been squandered.With nearly 4,000 men aged 18-20 in prison in the U.K. last year, according to official statistics, helping them find meaningful and stable work when they leave custody is a key priority.About one in three adult prisoners commit a crime within a year of their release, government data shows, costing the country roughly 15 billion pounds annually."}
