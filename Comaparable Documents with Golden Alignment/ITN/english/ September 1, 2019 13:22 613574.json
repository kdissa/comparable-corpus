The test was carried out by U.S. Army soldiers at the Reagan test site in the Marshall Islands and comes weeks after North Korea fired a series of short-range missiles in protest against U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises and the adoption of new weapons.North Korea has condemned the U.S. anti-missile system. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June at the inter-Korean border and agreed to reopen working-level negotiations, but that has not yet happened."}
