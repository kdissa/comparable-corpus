Zverev bounced back after dropping the opening set to overhaul the seventh-seeded Japanese 3-6 6-1 6-4, eliminating him from the tournament for the second consecutive year. German Zverev will meet Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semi-finals on Saturday after the up-and-coming Greek upset third seed David Goffin 6-3 6-4. Murray’s withdrawal, announced earlier on Friday, gave Australia’s Alex de Minaur a free pass to the semi-finals where he will meet the winner of Andrey Rublev and American Denis Kudler."}
