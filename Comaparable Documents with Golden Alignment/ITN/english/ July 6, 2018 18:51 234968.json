The six and three-metre whales erupted from the ground in Piazza della Rotonda next to one of the capital’s most visited tourist spots, the Pantheon. Greenpeace activists were protesting against single-use plastics, leading to tonnes of plastic refuse littering the world’s seas. Greenpeace called on businesses such as Coca Cola, Ferrero, Nestlé and Haribo to do more to change packaging for their merchandise. Eight million tonnes of plastic bottles, packaging and other waste are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain."}
