A fall by Kyle’s younger brother Scott in the men’s final allowed the former world champion to challenge for the lead. On the last flat portion of the 630-metre track, Croxall surged ahead to overtake reigning double junior world champion Mirko Lahti of Finland and clinch the victory. The podium was completed by Luca Dallago of Austria. The win was Croxall’s first since 2015 and the 2012 world champion now leads the overall standings. Lahti is in second place overall with Scott Croxall third. In the women’s final, Trunzo led from start to finish to win her third consecutive race, finishing ahead of Switzerland’s Anaïs Morand."}
