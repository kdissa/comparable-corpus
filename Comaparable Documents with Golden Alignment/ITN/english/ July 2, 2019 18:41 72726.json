Accordingly, the current fine for the offence, 250,000 rupees will be doubled. Chairman of the National Transport Commission JanakaMallimarachchi says that the decision to increase the fine was taken at a meeting chaired by Transport Minister ArjunaRanatunga. At present there are about 200 buses that do not have inter-provincial transport licenses. The Transport Commission is of the view that this is a great injustice to the licensed bus operators. Also, this has caused frequent clashes among bus owners. JanakaMallimarachchi further stated that highest number of buses that are running without interprovincial licenses has reported from the Jaffna Colombo bus route."}
