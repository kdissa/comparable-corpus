Discussions at this meeting dealt at length on issues that led to the continued losses incurred during the past several years and the current challenges faced as well as on the present operations. Attention was drawn to the disadvantageous agreements reached by the Airlines and the impact on the fuel prices increase, the depreciation of the rupee and currencies in the region and technical and infrastructure deficiencies.
