Boeing said the funds are an initial investment to be paid over a number of years to support education, hardship and living expenses of the families of the victims who were killed in the “tragic accidents” of Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 and the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. The two air crashes, both involving Boeing 737 Max 8 jets, killed 346 people in total and led to the global grounding of the 737 Max aircraft since the beginning of March. Boeing chairman, president and CEO Dennis Muilenburg expressed “deepest sympathies” for the families of those victims, hoping the funds will “help bring them comfort."}
