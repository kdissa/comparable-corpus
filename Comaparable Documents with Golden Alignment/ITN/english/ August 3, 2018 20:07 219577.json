Eth Pawura will go down in history as a strong media task of strengthening the local entrepreneurs in collaboration with social entrepreneurs and investment resources contributors. Advisor to the World University Service in Canada, Professor Edward Jackson said that the programme Eth Pawura is the number one reality programme that attracted not only locally but also foreign audience attraction. The Eth Pawura programme can be described as one of the social tasks done by ITN with the aim of achieving the economic goals of the present Government by 2025. We have commenced the second operation of the programme with the help of economic powers to help raise the standard of the Sri Lankan social entrepreneurs. The inking of the agreement for the second stage of Eth Pawura took place recently under the guidance of ITNâ€™s former Chairman Saman Athaudahetti and the current Chairperson Thilaka Jayasundera. The Sampath Bank, the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and Horizon Campus are the sponsors. A two-day workshop was held to discuss further upgrading the standard of the task of empowering the social entrepreneurs to solicit the support of foreign expertise. It was organized under the patronage of Chairman of Lanka Impact Investing Networks Chandula Abeywickrema."}
