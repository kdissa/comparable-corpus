Suninen mastered the tricky 3.37 kilometre Clocaenog speed test in his Ford Fiesta to top the charts in two minutes, 01.2 seconds – 0.2 seconds faster than Jari- Matti Latvala, Sebastien Ogier and Elfyn Evans. Estonian driver Ott Tanak, who has a real chance of winning the overall title after chalking up three straight victories, suffered a big crash at a difficult corner, while Andreas Mikkelsen almost suffered the same fate at the same corner. Mikkelsen was only tenth fastest while championship leader Thierry Neuville was sixth quickest in his Hyundai."}
