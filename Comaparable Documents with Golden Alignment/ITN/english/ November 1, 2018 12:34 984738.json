The diver, identified as Hendra, was reported as saying they’d dug the black box, orange in colour and intact, out of mud and debris. He did not specify if the item was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder. Indonesia deployed divers on Tuesday (October 30) to search for the cockpit recorders with “pinger locators” and find out why an almost-new plane went down in the sea minutes after take-off.Ground staff lost contact with flight JT610 of budget airline Lion Air 13 minutes after the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft took off early on Monday (October 29) from the airport in Jakarta, the capital, on its way to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang."}
