Ramazan month is the 9th month of the Islamic calendar. As the new moon was sighted, Islamic devotees all over the world commenced celebrating Ramazan festival. Issuing a congratulatory message, President Maithripala Sirisena says the fasting period led by the Islamic devotees, withholding worldly pleasures, sacrificing, indulging in religious rituals and offering onesâ€™ own earnings to the poor and the helpless symbolizes the spirituality common to all South Asian religious philosophies. He added that a religion that teaches to experience the hunger of others and to learn to sacrifice to merge with others is, indeed, an invaluable gift to society. In this long journey of human civilization, we come across all the religious practices, beliefs and philosophies of the world. The President pointed out that thus the common string of humanity is much further than the religious followings.
