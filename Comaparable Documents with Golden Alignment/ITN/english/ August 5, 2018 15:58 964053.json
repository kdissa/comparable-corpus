Having a place to live once they get there is another challenge. British architectural design and engineering firm Foster and Partners has submitted a concept to NASA and the European Space Agency where a swarm of small robots would autonomously 3D print a Mars base in preparation for human arrival. Sending heavy building materials to Mars isnâ€™t viable, but using the loose soil and rocks found there could be the answer. The vision is for a multi-robot swarm to use laser sintering to add layers of Martian regolith over an inflatable structure, creating a hard outer shell that could withstand the harsh environment."}
