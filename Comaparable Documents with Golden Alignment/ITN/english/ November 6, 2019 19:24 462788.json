Anura Kumara Dissanayake made the comment at the public gathering that was held in front of the Central Bus Stand of Kandy. The event had been organized by the chief organizer of the JVP in the Kandy district, Dayan Charaka Herath. Anura Kumara Dissanayake said each and every citizen should be granted with housing and health facilities along with a quality education for the children. The candidate pointed out that a large number of people still remain deprived of such primary necessities, despite the repeated promises of the politicians. He attested that they already have meticulously formed plans to truly develop the nation. Meanwhile, the Presidential candidate attended another public gathering that was held at the Rikillagaskadawala area in Hanguranketha. Addressing the gathering, Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the vile political culture that prevailed, has left an impoverished nation and wealthy politicians. It is acceptable that politicians prosper in a booming economy. The exact opposite is happening in Sri Lanka. Solely that should be enough for the people to reconsider their political views. Pointing out that it is futile to expect traditional politics to change, Anura Kumara Dissanayake invited all people to join hands for a radical change."}
