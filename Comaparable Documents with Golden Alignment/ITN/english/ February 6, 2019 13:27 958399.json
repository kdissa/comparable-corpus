The club was created in 1886, 10 years before the first modern Olympics were held in Athens, where fencing was one of the sports. In a small room where swords clink and the scent of leather and steel suffuses with sweat, students are taught that fencing is not just a sport, but also an art. The club, situated in Paris’s Latin Quarter, is open to everyone. Following tradition, every new student who arrives faces the master of arms, Jean-Pierre de Pinel de La Taule, and executes some exercises against his leather plastron. De La Taule says technique and the beauty of gestures are paramount to scoring points."}
