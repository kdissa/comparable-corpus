{"Header": "Outsider favored to win El Salvador presidential election", "Time": " February 1, 2019 12:58 ", "Content": "The two parties that have ruled El Salvador for three decades could lose their grip on power if voters choose as president a young outsider from a small third party who has vowed to lift the economy and stem the flow of migrants from one of the worldâ€™s most violent countries. Opinion polls in the Central American country give former San Salvador mayor Nayib Bukele a strong lead, which could make him the first leader not drawn from the left- and right-wing parties that have ruled El Salvador since 1989. The ruling Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), needs a massive upset if the leftist party is to cling to power. Its traditional rival, the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), also lags well behind Bukele, who belongs to a smaller right-wing party called the Great Alliance for National Unity (GANA)."}
