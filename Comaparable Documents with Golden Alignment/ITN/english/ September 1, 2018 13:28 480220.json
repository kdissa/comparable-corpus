Serena was able to continue but at the first changeover called a medical timeout and had her ankle heavily strapped.In the end, though, the only pain being felt was by Venus, who suffered the equal worst defeat in 30 matches against her sister.Seven times a Grand Slam winner, Venus held her opening serve but it was all downhill from there as a ruthless Serena swept through the next seven games to take the opening set in a breezy 31 minutes and a 2-0 lead in the second."}
