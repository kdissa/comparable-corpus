The machine factory was the site of the July 28, 2017, launch of a Hwasong-14 ICBM that Kim observed. North Korean state news agency KCNA released reports of Kim providing “field guidance” at a number of factories and cities, without saying when the visits happened. The reports only mentioned economic elements, but the sites help form the core of North Korea’s arms industry, and have played a major role in developing its intercontinental ballistic missile technology. Kim also visited the Kanggye General Tractor Plant and the Kanggye General Precision Machine Plant. Both plants are linked to the defense industry and may have played a role in the missile programme."}
