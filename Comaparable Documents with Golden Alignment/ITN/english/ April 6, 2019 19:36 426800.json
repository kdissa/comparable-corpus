Doctors and staff of all hospitals in the Uva Province launched a strike action last Wednesday in protest over the incident, by withdrawing from all duties excluding essential services. This had crippled services at government hospitals across the province as a large number of patients were left stranded and unable to receive treatment. However, representatives of the Government Medical Officers’ Association including its Uva Province coordinator met with the chief minister for a discussion last night at the Governor’s Office to resolve the issue. At the meeting, the Chief Minister had handed over a letter expressing his regret over the hardships faced by the public as a result of the strike action."}
