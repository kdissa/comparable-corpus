Iran has no fear of “new American threats,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, referring to November 4, when a wind-down period imposed by Washington expires, after which certain sanctions will be re-imposed. The Trump administration said that eight importing countries would temporarily be allowed to keep buying Iranian oil when sanctions come back into effect. Iran is the world’s No. 3 oil exporter."}
