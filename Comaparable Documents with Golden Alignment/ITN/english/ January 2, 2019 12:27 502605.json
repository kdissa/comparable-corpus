On New Year’s Day of 1959, Cuba’s U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista fled as Fidel Castro and his bearded revolutionaries seized control of the Caribbean country. Alongside Fidel was his brother, Raul Castro, who now heads the country’s Communist Party. Speaking at an event in Santiago de Cuba to mark the anniversary, Raul Castro said Havana seeks mutual bilateral relations with the U.S.A.. Under President Donald Trump, warming diplomatic relations have been under strain with Washington unwinding economic ties and putting in place new sanctions. It comes as Havana plans more austerity amidst sluggish growth, falling export earnings and rising debt. Castro blamed the U.S.’s blockade on the local economy for part of its woes. In recent years, Cuba has sought to modernise its revolution and economy by easing restrictions on private property and foreign investment."}
