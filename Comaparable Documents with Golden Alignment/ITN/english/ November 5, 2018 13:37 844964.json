The Sabarimala temple in the southern state of Kerala, which will open its gate to devotees, has been the cause of tension since India’s top court ruled last month that banning some women from entering infringed on freedom to worship. The protests in Tamil Nadu state come ahead of a review hearing on November 13. Ahead of the review, the temple is ready to open its gates for a day for the devotees. Hardline Hindu groups say the prohibition on women of menstrual age entering is required to appease the temple’s chief deity, Ayyappan, depicted as a yoga-practising God considered eternally celibate by followers."}
