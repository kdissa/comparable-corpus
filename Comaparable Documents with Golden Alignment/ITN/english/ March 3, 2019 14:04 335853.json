The Foal Eagle field exercise, which usually involves thousands of combined ground, air, naval and special operations troops, takes place every spring. Key Resolve is a computer-simulated exercise. The United States and South Korea have suspended a number of military exercises since the first summit last year between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump to encourage talks with North Korea."}
