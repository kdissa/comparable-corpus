It is hoping to broadcast the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games using the new format.Television manufacturers including Samsung and LG have announced 8K-capable television sets, but they are still prohibitively expensive for widespread adoption.NHK’s new channel BS8K will broadcast programmes for about 12 hours a day.The first programme at 10:00 local time (01:00 GMT) will be an information broadcast, highlighting future shows on the channel."}
