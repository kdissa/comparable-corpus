Attacking midfielder Leroy Sane was a surprise omission from Joachim Loew’s final Germany squad for the World Cup finals as goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was named among the 23 players heading to Russia for the defending champions. Neuer made the squad despite playing in just one official game, a friendly against Austria, since breaking a bone in his foot in September but talented 22-year-old Sane was the highest-profile player excluded. The Manchester City midfielder, goalkeeper Bernd Leno, forward Nils Petersen and defender Jonathan Tah were the four players that failed to make the cut from Loew’s provisional list."}
