The new Neptune cruise missile, able to hit naval targets at a distance of 280 km, showed “a very good result” at the testing ground according to Turchynov.The test launches come at a time of heightened tensions between Russia and the West over Russia’s seizure of two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tug boat and their crews in November."}
