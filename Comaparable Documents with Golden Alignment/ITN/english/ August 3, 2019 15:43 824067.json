One person suffered critical injuries when the slab of rock and debris fell onto Grandview Surf Beach in Encinitas, north of San Diego.Another victim was taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance, but their condition was not immediately known. A third person sustained minor injuries but declined treatment. Television images showed a large chunk of the bluff where it came to rest on the beach, not far from a lifeguard tower overlooking the Pacific Ocean and surrounded by beach blankets and toys. Search and rescue crews using cadaver dogs were combing through the heavy soil and stone to ensure that no additional victims were underneath."}
