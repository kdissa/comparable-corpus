The escalation, which comes just ahead of both the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Israelâ€™s Independence Day holiday, prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to convene security chiefs. Egyptian mediators, credited with brokering ceasefires in previous rounds of violence, were working to prevent further hostilities. The latest round of violence began on Friday when a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper fired at Israeli troops, wounding two soldiers, according to the Israeli military. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said two Israelis were wounded by shrapnel."}
