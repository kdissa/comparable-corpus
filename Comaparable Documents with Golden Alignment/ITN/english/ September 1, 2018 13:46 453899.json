Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF director of emergency programmes, said that the agency has drawn up contingency plans including providing clean water and nutritional supplies to some of the estimated 450,000 to 700,000 people who could flee an attack.Idlib and surrounding areas are the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a close Russian ally. He also remains concerned about 2 million children that are still out of school which create a long-term impact and “a lot of anxiety” for the children and the families."}
