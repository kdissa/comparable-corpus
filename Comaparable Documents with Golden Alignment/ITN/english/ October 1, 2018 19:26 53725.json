The Children’s Day commemoration will be held in a novel way and will be organized by the Independent Television Network in collaboration with the Ministry of Education. Many children from Colombo as well as from Trincomalee, Anuradhapura, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu District are scheduled to join in the World Children’s Day commemoration. Plans are afoot to seek the participation of about 2000 Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim children. The Independent Television Media Network has made arrangements to add many features for these children. Noteworthy is the arrangements made by the ITN Media Network to hold the World Children’s Day commemoration centering a very remote area in the island devoid of traditional Children’s Day festivals."}
