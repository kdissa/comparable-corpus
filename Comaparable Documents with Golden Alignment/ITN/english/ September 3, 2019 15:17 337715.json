Watched by friend Tiger Woods, the second-seeded Spaniard was in cruise control as he took the first set behind some superb serving and stout defence but the big-hitting Croatian battled back to snatch the second. That was as good as it would get for Cilic, however, the momentum shifting decisively in Nadalâ€™s favour when he jumped in the air to hit a spectacular backhand smash that electrified the crowd. Cilic would double fault later in the game to give Nadal a 3-1 lead and he would never threaten again on a hot and humid night in New York."}
