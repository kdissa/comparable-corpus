With 35 wickets having tumbled inside three days, England will be hoping they can grab the five remaining Indian wickets quickly on day four so that they can mark their 1000th test with a victory.England’s bowlers made the most of the new ball in slightly overcast conditions by reducing the visitors to 78-5 in a fierce spell of swing bowling after the tea break.With the exception of Kohli, none of the Indian top order batsmen looked at ease against the bowlers with Stuart Broad the pick of the attack with two wickets."}
