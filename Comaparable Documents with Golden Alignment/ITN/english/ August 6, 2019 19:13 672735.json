AjithMannapperuma was speaking at a media briefing held at the Government Information Department. The State Minister noted that coloring of the bottle is done with the view of misleading the consumers. He pointed out that people tend to buy blue colored water bottles with the wrong perception that water inside in the bottle is clean. As the plastic bottles are being colored for narrow purposes, recycling process has also been hindered. According to the Minister, around 10 million plastic bottles are being used on daily basis and the polythene seal on the lid is meaningless and waste of materials. The State Minister said that the polythene being thrown out to the environment cannot be recycled."}
