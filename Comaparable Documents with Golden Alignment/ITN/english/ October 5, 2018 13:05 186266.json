Chung holds a near two-hour lead over the rest of the field having completed 120 kilometres in ten hours and 55 minutes and appears to be mastering the difficult desert conditions. Japan’s Takuya Wakaoka is in second place, one hour and 39 minutes adrift, with France’s Christophe Santini 25 minutes behind Wakaoka in third. The women’s race is much closer with China’s Ling Pe in front, but she only has a three-minute lead over the UK’s Hannah Walsh."}
