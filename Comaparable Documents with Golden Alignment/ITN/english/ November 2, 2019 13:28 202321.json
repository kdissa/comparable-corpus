The city’s schools have also been closed until at least next Tuesday.All construction has been halted for a week and fireworks have been banned. From Monday, the city will introduce a temporary scheme so that only cars with odd or even numbered licence plates can drive on given days, in a bid to cut traffic pollution.Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city had been turned into a “gas chamber”.The masks are being handed out to students and their parents, and Mr Kejriwal has asked people to use them as much as possible."}
