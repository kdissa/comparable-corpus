Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa had recently summoned a news conference with respect to the protest organized by the joint Opposition. At this news conference he said that a large group would be spending the night in the Colombo City. Some social media had described this protest as a loitering effort of thugs and thieves. It is enough to introduce a long line of revelations of this kind of mockery without the need of daylight for the purpose of thievery. Another side of the power struggle of Rajapaksas is clear through this effort."}
