The Government immediately ordered the conduct of a full investigation into the matter with the revelation that such an incident had taken place. Accordingly, the Criminal Investigations Department commenced a special investigation. The results of the inquiry were intimated to Swiss Ambassador Hanspeter Mock. It was joined by Defence Secretary (Retd) Major General Kamal Gunaratne and Foreign Secretary Ravinatha Ariyasinghe. Officials including the Criminal Investigations Department pointed out that a statement should be obtained from officer said to have faced this incident. The non-availability of an opportunity in this respect is an obstacle for the inquiries. The Defence Secretary and the Foreign Secretary has said that since this officer had stated that she was injured in the abduction she should be directed for a Medical examination. They called on the Swiss Ambassador to support the Sri Lankan Government to determine the real situation with regard to the incident said to have occurred. Meanwhile, a demonstration organized demanding that the Swiss Embassy officer be produced before the Police to record a statement was held near the Swiss Embassy. The demonstrators pointed out that it is necessary to interrogate her if this worker had been subject to any pressure. The demonstrators pointed out that if not the allegations made by her are unilateral and it was an obstruction for the investigations."}
