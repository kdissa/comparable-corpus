The first marathon was in Novo, Antarctica with athletes now having completed four more legs in Perth, Cape Town, Dubai and Madrid. In the men’s event, Michael Wardian of the United States has dominated, winning each of the first five legs to hold an overall lead of over 90 minutes. In the women’s race, Susannah Gill of Great Britain has won four of the legs to lead overall. Whilst there is plenty of action in the races, the real challenge for athletes is rest and recuperation. They have to eat when they can, be it at the airport or on board and get enough rest to ward off fatigue."}
