Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s immunization, vaccines and biologicals department, said that there were 9.7 million measles cases in 2018, up from 7.5 million in 2017. The anti-vaccination movement has made the fight against measles more difficult, with anti-vax advocates “largely spreading misinformation”. A growing and vocal fringe of people opposes vaccinations, believing, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in the vaccines can cause autism or other disorders."}
