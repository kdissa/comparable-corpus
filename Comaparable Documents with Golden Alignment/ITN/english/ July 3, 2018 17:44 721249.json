Hot weather and wind over the last week have sparked fires in parts of the northern English countryside unprecedented in recent times in an area better known for its rainy weather. It had around 120 personnel battling wildfires in seven areas between Tameside to the east of the city, and the Winter Hill area to the northwest. Meanwhile, more than 1,200 firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters battled a wildfire raging out of control in Northern California, threatening homes and other structures as thick black smoke drifted across the San Francisco Bay Area. The so-called County Fire, which broke out in Yolo County west of Sacramento, has already blackened more than 50 square miles of grass, brush and dense scrub oak."}
