Thousands of people clad in yellow, the colour of the Nasheed-led opposition, lined streets in the capital to greet him. The former president’s return comes after the Maldives Supreme Court stayed his 13-year sentence on terrorism charges this week. He has said the charges were politically motivated. The Maldives under Yameen grew close to China – to the alarm of traditional ally India – with China funding roads, bridges and an extension to the international airport as part of its Belt and Road Initiative of infrastructure projects in almost 70 countries from Mongolia to Montenegro."}
