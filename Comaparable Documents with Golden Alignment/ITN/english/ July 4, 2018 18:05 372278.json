Sent in to bat by Zimbabwe in Australia’s second match of the T20 tri-series, opener Finch unleashed on the depleted hosts, racing to a half-century from 22 deliveries before bringing up his second T20I century from 50 balls. Zimbabwe had no answers for the powerful right-hander, who struck a maximum in the 19th over to better his previous mark of 156, scored against England in 2013, as Australia posted 2-229. Finch’s blitz finally ended in bizarre circumstances, with the Australian skipper out hit wicket chasing a wide delivery from Blessing Muzarabani on the penultimate ball of the innings, ending a knock that featured 16 fours and 10 sixes. He was just three runs short of the highest ever 20-over score – a mammoth 175no scored by Chris Gayle in the Indian Premier League in 2013."}
