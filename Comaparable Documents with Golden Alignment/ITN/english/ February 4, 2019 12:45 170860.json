The weather bureau warned of “dangerous and high velocity flows” along the Ross River after the flood gates were opened fully at the Ross River dam, releasing about 1,900 cubic metres of water a second. Even after the release the dam was still at 229 percent capacity, holding about 532,000 gigalitres of water, or roughly as much as Sydney Harbour. Meanwhile, an Italian fire brigade rescue helicopter winched to safety three people and six Carabinieri military policemen after the Reno River bursts its banks near the northern Italy city of Bologna. The military policemen were helping people to evacuate their homes in the flooded area of Castel Maggiore, when the water level of the river suddenly rose, flooding the road. The nine people, who were showing initial signs of hypothermia, have been eventually evacuated by firefighters using a helicopter."}
