The UK is going to the polls on 12 December following a further delay to the UK’s departure from the EU, to 31 January 2020.Mr Johnson hopes to win a majority of seats so that he can get his deal through Parliament – while Mr Corbyn promises another referendum if he wins the keys to 10 Downing Street."}
