The fiery Kyrgios threw everything he had at Nadal – including an extraordinary 143mph second-serve ace – and undoubtedly had him rattled before the Spaniard eventually prevailed 6-3 3-6 7-6(5) 7-6(3).Nadal was in complete control in the early stages and Kyrgios seemingly needed an injection of emotion – or anger – to fire him up. The Spaniard duly provided it with his slow-motion movement between points and a surprise toilet break after the first set. The Australian made his mark when he blasted a 143mph second serve-ace – the fastest serve of any sort during the tournament so far and the second-fastest second serve in ATP history. He followed up with another ace – via a gentle under-arm lob – though still lost the first set comfortably."}
