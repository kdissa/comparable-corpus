Eight players have already been selected for the 42nd edition of the Ryder Cup which gets underway on the outskirts of Paris on September 28. But Danish skipper Bjorn still has to select those who didn’t qualify automatically. 2016 Open champion Henrik Stenson, 2017 Masters winner Sergio Garcia, Ryder Cup stalwart Ian Poulter and 13-time European Tour winner Paul Casey are among those who are hoping for a wildcard pick. Thomas Pieters – who accrued a record four points for a rookie two years ago – and Matthew Fitzpatrick are among the 2016 debutants hoping to be selected."}
