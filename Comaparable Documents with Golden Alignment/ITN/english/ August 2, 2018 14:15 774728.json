The former France international’s lawyer had said Nasri was sanctioned for receiving an intravenous drip treatment at a clinic in Los Angeles in 2016, when he was on loan at Sevilla from City.UEFA said Nasri’s amended suspension was a result of negotiations between the player, WADA, the French Anti-Doping Agency and UEFA’s Ethics and Disciplinary inspector, who originally believed a two-year suspension was warranted."}
