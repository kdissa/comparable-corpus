A middle-aged man in Barcelona, who media said appeared to be homeless, was found collapsed on a street and taken to hospital where he later died of heatstroke, Catalonia’s civil protection agency said in a statement. Two other men – a roadworker in his 40s and a 78-year-old pensioner – also died from heatstroke this week. The highest temperature ever recorded in Europe was 48 degrees in. Europe’s heatwave gripped Spain and Portugal, as governments checked for forest fires, a Budapest game reserve fed its animals iced snacks and a Finnish supermarket invited customers to sleep over to stay cool."}
