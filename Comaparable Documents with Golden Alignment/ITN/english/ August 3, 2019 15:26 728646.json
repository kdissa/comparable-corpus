Frenchman Benoit lost his temper in the third game of the second set when top seed Tsitsipas halted the match to attend to a broken shoe lace. Benoit told the chair umpire the Greek was stalling for time and claimed it was a pattern with Tsitsipas, who also stopped play to attend to problems with his footwear in his last two matches.Once play resumed and Benoit lost a point, the Frenchman pretended to have a shoe issue of his own and sat in his chair, testing the chairâ€™s patience but earning no warning.Benoit failed to regain his composure after the argument and Tsitsipas cruised to the win on a warm night in the U.S. capital. Kyrgios later hammered down 19 aces and needed just under an hour to defeat Slovakian lucky loser Norbert Gombos 6-3 6-3 under the lights."}
