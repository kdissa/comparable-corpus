Some of charges include abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering related to a former subsidiary of the state investment fund 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad). Multiple appeals by Najib’s legal team delayed the start of the trial. And, the sums of money involved in this first trial are just a fraction of the billions of dollars that prosecutors contend was illegally siphoned off from 1MDB. The charges relate to 10 million U.S. dollars prosecutors say was diverted from a subsidiary of 1MDB to Najib’s personal bank account. Najib faces nearly three-dozen other charges involving more than two billion dollars in total. The prosecution plans to introduce thousands of pages of documents, and calls some 60 witnesses."}
