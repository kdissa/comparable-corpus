An Indonesian navy frigate arrived in the damaged harbor outside Palu carrying boxes of bottled water and other supplies to the survivors, but local people said it was too little and too late after the horrifying tsunami swamped the area.

Many victims are feared to still be buried in the ruins of Palu, the provincial capital, and in the districts of Donggala and Sigi."}
