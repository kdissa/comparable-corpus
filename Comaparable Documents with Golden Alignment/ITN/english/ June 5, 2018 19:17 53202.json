The official death toll from the destruction at the Fuego volcano has risen to 69. Thousands of people are being housed in temporary shelters. Volcanologists report the eruption, which sent ash up to 10km into the sky, is over for the moment. The eruption generated pyroclastic flows fast-moving mixtures of very hot gas and volcanic matter which descended down the slopes, engulfing communities such as El Rodeo and San Miguel Los Lotes."}
