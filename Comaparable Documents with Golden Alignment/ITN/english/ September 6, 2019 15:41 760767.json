She has also lost two Wimbledon finals since her return.Now all that stands between the 37-year-old and her Holy Grail is Canadian Bianca Andreescu who beat Swiss Belinda Bencic in the second semi-final. The match had looked to be a long and competitive affair when Svitolina forced Williams to fight off three break points to hold her opening serve.Williams, however, was ready for the challenge breaking Svitolina at the first opportunity by firing a winner down the line the Ukrainian could only look at."}
