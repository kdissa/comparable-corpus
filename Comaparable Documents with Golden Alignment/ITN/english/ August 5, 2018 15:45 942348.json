The Portuguese IPMA weather service is expecting 47C in Santarem in central Portugal, just below Europe’s record high of 48C, set in Athens in 1977. The previous record highs in both Spain and Portugal were just over 47C. Portuguese weather forecasters said the hot air from North Africa also brought particles of sand, which tend to subdue maximum temperatures slightly. In Portugal beaches near Lisbon, including Costa da Caparica, saw thousands of beachgoers cooling off, escaping from the extreme heat in the city while in the Spanish capital of Madrid, locals and tourists tried to cool off by having a walk in the city’s Retiro park."}
