Farmers markets in Seoul, the capital city, are losing customers to supermarkets where air conditioners provided a much cooler shopping environment. The heat outside is so intense that even those who prefer going to the farmers market to avail affordable produce are now headed to the pricey supermarkets. While buyers pay more for their vegetables, sellers at farmers markets are suffering the pinch too with their businesses slowing down. The heat wave also affected the country’s agricultural output, hiking the prices of farm produce by 4.2 percent. Several regions across South Korea recorded highest temperatures ever."}
