Their demands include the granting of permanent appointments to Post Masters. The Minister of Posts summoned a news conference to make clarifications with respect to the strike. Minister M.H. A. Halim said that he directed a cabinet memorandum two months ago to sort out this issue. The Cabinet directed it to the Sub Committee. Dr. Sarath Amunugama is serving as the head of this Committee. Also the observation of some other divisions was needed. As such it was postponed. The Minister said that before the trade unions took action he discussed the issue with the trade Union along with Minister Sarath Amunugama and the others concerned. At this discussion a decision was taken to sort out this issue within two weeks. He called on the workers to call off this strike as it could be solved within two weeks."}
