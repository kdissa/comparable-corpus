The 17th edition of the continental football championship has introduced many firsts: first time to use a video assistant referee and the first time to adopt a fourth substitute rule and the biggest change was that the number of teams competing increased from 16 to 24. The Asian Cup also has a new championship trophy, designed by a British company from 15 kilograms of silver. The trophy depicts the five regions of the AFC organically entwined in harmony and competition, which coincides with the slogan of the 2019 Asian Cup: Bringing Asia Together. The month-long tournament got underway on Saturday with the host nation, UAE, converting a penalty to salvage a point against Bahrain in a 1-1 draw in Group A."}
