Gun access advocacy group Defense Distributed was due to put downloadable gun blueprints online. The firm reached a settlement with the Trump administration in June to allow it to legally publish the instructions. But eight states and the District of Columbia sued the government to block the settlement, arguing the untraceable guns were a safety risk. US District Judge Robert Lasnik issued a temporary restraining order halting the release, saying the blueprints could fall into the wrong hands."}
