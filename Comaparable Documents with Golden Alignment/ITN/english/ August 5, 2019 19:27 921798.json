{"Header": "Court rules that Wigneswaranâ€™s sacking of NPC minister is illegal", "Time": " August 5, 2019 19:27 ", "Content": "The Appeals Court has ruled that the decision taken by former Northern chief minister C. V. Vigneswaran to remove former Northern provincial minister B. Denishwaran was unconstitutional. The two-member judge bench comprising Justices Mahinda Samayawardena and Priyantha Fernando claimed that a chief minister does not have the authority to remove such individuals from office. The Court ruled that only the governor of a province has been vested with the authority to sack a provincial minister from office. Denishwaran had filed a contempt of court case against Mr. Vigneswaran and two other provincial ministers by stating that they had failed to carry out an Appeal court order instructing to re-appoint him to office."}
