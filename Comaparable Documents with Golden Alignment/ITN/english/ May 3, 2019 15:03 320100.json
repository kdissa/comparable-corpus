These artifacts that escaped the war and political chaos back home have traveled around the world since 2006. The visual feast featuring over 230 precious items is divided into four series based on the sites from where they were excavated. These items represent cultural heritage from the Bronze Age, the Hellenistic period and the Kushan dynasty, as well as the period between the invasion of the Yuezhi people and the establishment of the Kushan dynasty. Some of the oldest items on display date back more than four millenniums. The exhibits, with golden objects being the biggest attraction, were partly accidentally discovered in 1965 by Afghan farmers in Tepe Fullol, a village in northern Afghanistan."}
