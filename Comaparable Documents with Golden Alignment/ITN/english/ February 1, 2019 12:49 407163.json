Japan Airlines’ (JAL) Flight 740, a Boeing 787, from New Delhi, India, lost control of its left main landing gear while taxiing to the arrival gate, the airport said. No injuries were reported. Japanese media quoted the plane’s captain as saying he believed there was ice on the runway, leading to the aircraft skidding when the brakes were applied. Footage broadcast on TV Tokyo showed the aircraft stranded, with one set of wheels on the snow-covered ground beside the runway. Passengers were reportedly escorted to the terminal building on buses after being stuck on board for a few hours."}
