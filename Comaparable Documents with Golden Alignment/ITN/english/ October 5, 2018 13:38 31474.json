The southern African nation of more than 13 million people last month appealed locally for help to raise $35 million to buy vaccines and medicines and to repair water and sewer pipes. Some 1.4 million will be vaccinated, starting with those in the most densely populated areas. The outbreak of the water borne disease has exposed the lack of maintenance of the country’s infrastructure. Zimbabwe’s worst cholera outbreak occurred in 2008 during the height of the economic crisis, leaving more than 4,000 dead and infecting another 40,000."}
