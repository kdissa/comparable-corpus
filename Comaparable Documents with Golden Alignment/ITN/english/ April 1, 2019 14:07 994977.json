Sutino “Kinong” Hadi, has pioneered the concept of mobile libraries in Jakarta by hauling books rather than hauling customers. Kinong began his career as a bemo driver in the 1980s. A common, and now iconic, public transport in Indonesia. But in 2017, the government decided to ban its operations in Jakarta. That immediately put Kinong out of job, until a few years ago when he decided to modify one of his old bemos for a good cause. Kinong began spreading his love for books and reading in 2013. Often driving around for hours in narrow alleys with his stash of books behind him. In 2016, a research showed that Indonesia ranks second-last in reading interest."}
