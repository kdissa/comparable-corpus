The mission, which set sail on April 25 and returns at the end of May, will drill into the seabed and use a pipe to blow carbon dioxide up through two metres of the sea floor and into the water.The team will then use multiple sensors to assess the controlled leak. The hope is the experiment will help develop sensors and methods for detecting and monitoring gas seepage in the future. Such technology could be used if carbon capture usage and storage is deployed in depleted oil and gas reservoirs in our seas. CCUS involves capturing carbon before it enters the atmosphere and burying it to prevent it damaging the atmosphere."}
