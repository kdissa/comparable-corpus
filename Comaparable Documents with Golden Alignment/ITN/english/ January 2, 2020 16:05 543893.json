This year four divers took the plunge, some with more style than others, plummeting off the 30-metre Cavour bridge in the centre of the Italian capital. Veteran diver Maurizio Palmulli, known as Mr. O.K., traditionally took his place for the final dive, saluting the crowd after being pulled from the water onto a rescue boat."}
