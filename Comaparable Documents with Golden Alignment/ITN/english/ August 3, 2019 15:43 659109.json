Scripps began deploying the buoy for year-long stints on the seabed in the Barrow Strait in the Canadian Arctic in 2013, aiming to use the sounds it registered to better understand the impact of climate change on the region’s marine life. The buoy would record ambient ocean noises, from the whir of passing ships’ propellers or the vibrations of distant offshore oil drilling, to the high-pitched clicks of Beluga whales."}
