Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath said that publicity given by certain social websites are totally false. Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath said that a misleading reported has been published in the Lankadeepa Website that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna will be supporting Ranil Wickremasinghe. He emphasized that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna had not mentioned it at any time or any place and that such a thing would happen. He claimed that the JVP is a party that used its vote against Ranil Wickremasinghe in the no confidence motion. What they wish to say is that what has happened at present is unconstitutional and they were forcing the President to immediately convene Parliament to sort out this issue."}
