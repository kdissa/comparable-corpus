Bangkok’s air quality has fallen to harmful levels with the quantity of unsafe dust particles, known as PM2.5, exceeding what is considered safe around the capital, according to the country’s Department of Pollution Control. PM2.5 are microscopic particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter and are considered particularly harmful because they are small enough to lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs. The toxic air has forced a total of 437 public schools in the Thai capital to suspend classes since Wednesday. Local authorities has responded by deploying a fleet of 50 drones to spray water into the air and eliminate some of the pollution. Sonthi Kotchawat, a senior environmental health expert, warned that long-terms efforts must be taken to tackle of root cause of air pollution, which he believes comes from the motor vehicles on the city’s streets."}
