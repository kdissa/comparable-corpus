Paulo Paulino Guajajara was reportedly attacked and shot in the head while hunting inside the Arariboia reservation in Maranhao state. He was a member of Guardians of the Forest, a group formed to combat logging gangs in the area. The killing increases concerns about escalating violence against Amazon forest protectors. Non-profit group Survival International, which advocates for isolated communities, says at least three Guardians have previously been killed, along with many of their relatives."}
