While Cummins leapfrogged James Anderson to No. 2 after picking 14 wickets in two Tests against Sri Lanka, Holder’s five wickets in the second Test in Antigua that completed a series win against England lifted him to sixth position. Holder, who last week became the first West Indies player to become the top-ranked Test all-rounder since Sir Garry Sobers in 1974, now has 778 points, the highest by any West Indies bowler since Courtney Walsh in 2001."}
