England had previously lost all three World Cup shootouts and three of four in the European Championship but prevailed on Tuesday when Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca failed to convert, leaving Eric Dier to win the game for England. Earlier Harry Kane smashed in a 57th-minute penalty, his sixth goal of the tournament, and England looked to be through until Yerry Mina headed an equaliser in the third minute of stoppage time.It was Englandâ€™s first win in a knockout game since 2006 and earns them a quarter-final with Sweden , who were far from impressive in beating Switzerland 1-0 earlier on Tuesday."}
