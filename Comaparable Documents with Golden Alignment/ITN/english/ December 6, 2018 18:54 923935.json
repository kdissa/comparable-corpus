Former Minister P.E.D. Premaratne emphasized that former leaders always portrayed democracy within the Party. Mr. Premaratne further said that everyone who served as leaders of the Party throughout history totally safeguarded democracy within the Party. As a person who has experience by serving under Presidents such as J.R. Jayawardena and R. Premadasa he recalled the manner in which they respected democracy within the party. Accordingly former peopleâ€™s representatives of the party claim that the United National Party had a long history on decisions taken to party leadership and the Prime Ministerial candidate based on a consent of the majority. However, P.E.D. Premaratne pointed out that the present leader of the United National Party has assumed the leadership to cling on to that position during his lifetime. He further pointed out that their party will have no future if this situation is not altered."}
