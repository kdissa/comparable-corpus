Models wandered calmly through an all-white showroom-turned-catwalk which was lined with mannequins wearing prototypes from the collection, a glimpse behind the scenes. Only a handful of houses are officially allowed to style themselves “Haute Couture” with a number of major brands including Louis Vuitton and Saint Laurent absent from the club."}
