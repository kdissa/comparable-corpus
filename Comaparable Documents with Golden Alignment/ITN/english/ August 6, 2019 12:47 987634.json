Needing to bat out the day to earn a draw chasing 398 to win was never in the offing England at one stage lost six wickets for 37 runs on the way to being bowled out for 146 at Edgbaston. Off-spinner Nathan Lyon took advantage of the worn pitch to claim 6-49, while paceman Pat Cummins picked up 4-32 as the tourists surged to victory just before tea. It puts them ahead in an Ashes series in the UK for the first time in 14 years. England can rightly point to the fact they have been without pace bowler James Anderson for almost the whole game he pulled up with a recurrence of a calf injury after bowling only four overs on the first morning."}
