For a long period potato farmers struggled to get a fair price for their harvest. They staged protests to get the fair price for their harvest. Although measures were taken to purchase the harvest, payments for the farmers were not made in a proper manner. Potatoes farmer associations and Sri Lanka consumer cooperative society associations briefed Minister Johnston Fernando in this regard. The Minister informed the President and the Prime Minister and took measures to obtain speedy solutions to the problem. Accordingly the Cabinet approved the Cabinet Paper submitted to pay the arrears of the potato farmers and to purchase their harvest. Director of the Sri Lanka Consumer Cooperative Society Association Mohamed Riyaz handed over the relevant cheque to Minister Johnston Fernando today."}
