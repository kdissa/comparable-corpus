Francis prayed in silence in front of an icon of the saints Cyril and Methodius, two Byzantine Greek brothers who are attributed with converting Slavic peoples in central and Eastern Europe. Cyril is also credited with inventing an alphabet to translate religious texts into Slavonic, which was named Cyrillic after him. Accompanied by clerics from the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Francis toured the cathedral before going outside to say prayers to a crowd of pilgrims and members of the public."}
