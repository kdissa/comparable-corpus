The brand, known for its elaborate runway displays, recreated a beach in Paris’ Grand Palais exhibition centre, with front row guests including singer Pharell Williams and actress Pamela Anderson nestled behind a dune. As lifeguards looked on, models showed off strappy dresses, some adorned with coral details or brightly coloured sequined swirls, while silky numbers came with parasol motifs."}
