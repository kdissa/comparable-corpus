The 42nd World Heritage committee session is taking place from June 24th to July 4th in Manama, Bahrain. The committee is examining proposals to put 30 sites on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Among these proposals, part of France’s Auvergne region was designated as a protected site. Situated in the centre of France, the site comprises the long Limagne fault, the alignments of the Chaîne des Puys volcanoes and the inverted relief of the Montagne de la Serre. It is an emblematic segment of the West European Rift, created in the aftermath of the formation of the Alps, 35 million years ago."}
