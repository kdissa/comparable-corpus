At a Geneva news briefing, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic called the situation a “sad and frustrating milestone” and warned that security incidents are holding back the agency’s response. A key part of the Ebola response effort involves decontaminating health facilities, educating health workers on how to protect themselves and their patients, and persuading residents to seek treatment at specialized centres. But insecurity around Beni is undermining efforts to contain the outbreak, which has killed 1,346 people since the beginning of the outbreak. Militiamen attacked a hospital in the nearby city of Butembo last month and killed a Cameroonian doctor working for the health agency."}
