Turkey has the second-largest army in Nato, a 29-member military alliance set up to defend against what was at the time the Soviet Union.Mr Pence also rebuked Germany – another key Nato member – for not spending enough on its defence.Moscow has made no public comments on the latest developments.Relation between Nato and Russia have deteriorated over Moscow’s occupation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and its withdrawal from a key missile treaty."}
