The chase began about 6.30pm as the jet-skis were spotted racing from the Canary Wharf business district towards Central London, home of Britainâ€™s Houses of Parliament and a number of other key landmarks. The Metropolitan Police said its Marine Unit had responded to reports of jet-skis speeding along the river. It said the police boats were able to make the jet-skis change course and they then abandoned the chase for safety reasons."}
