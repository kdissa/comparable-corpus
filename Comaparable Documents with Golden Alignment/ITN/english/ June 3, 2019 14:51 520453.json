{"Header": "Wawrinka and Stephens through to fourth round of French Open", "Time": " June 3, 2019 14:51 ", "Content": "Former champion Stan Wawrinka thumped 62 winners as he outlasted Stefanos Tsitsipas in a bruising five-hour “battle of the backhands” to reach the last eight of the French Open. Wawrinka beat the sixth-seeded Greek 7-6(6) 5-7 6-4 3-6 8-6 to set up a meeting with fellow Swiss Roger Federer, who cruised past Leonardo Mayer of Argentina in straight sets. Wawrinka, who beat Federer in straight sets en route to the 2015 French Open title, clinched victory on his second match point, with a backhand that landed on the line on a sun-soaked Court Suzanne Lenglen. In the women’s singles, last year’s runner-up Sloane Stephens downed former champion Garbine Muguruza 6-4 6-3 to book her place in the quarter-finals."}
