The “Salute to America” event featured military flyovers and fireworks. Opponents accused Trump of wasting money and politicising the holiday ahead of his re-election campaign. The Pentagon has not revealed the cost of the extravaganza, which many believe was inspired by Trump’s visit to a Bastille Day parade hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron in 2017. Some reports say the National Park Service diverted nearly $2.5m to cover the cost."}
