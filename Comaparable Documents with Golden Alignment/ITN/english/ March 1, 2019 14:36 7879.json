The nine-day exercise is aimed at testing the readiness of command bases and operation centres throughout Turkey’s territorial waters, the defence ministry said.On board the frigate TCG Barbaros, gunners fired live ammunition at mock targets floating on the waves. Soldiers were lowered from helicopters onto another ship’s deck and others deployed a remotely operated underwater vehicle. The Barbaros was deployed in the Aegean Sea just north of the Gallipoli pensinsula, close to Turkey’s land border with Greece. The two NATO allies came to the brink of war in 1996 in a sovereignty dispute over islets in the Aegean.As part of the drill, the bases are also planning their operations and testing them on the Naval Warfare Game System, which was developed locally."}
