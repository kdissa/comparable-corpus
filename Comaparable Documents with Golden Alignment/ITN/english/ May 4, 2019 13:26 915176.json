Chasing a target of 184, the 19-year-old Gill showed his range on his ‘home turf’ with an attractive 65 not out off 49 balls, anchoring the chase after Chris Lynn (46 off 22 balls) set the pace with some big hits in the Powerplay overs. Not only did KKR reach the target in 18 overs but they also improved the net run-rate as they now have 12 points with a must-win away game against Mumbai Indians left. The opening duo added 62 in 6 overs before Lynn was dismissed having hit five fours and two sixes.Robin Uthappa looked good but didn’t stay long enough even as Gill, who hit five fours and two sixes carried on with minimum fuss.Andre Russell hit a couple of sixes in the 50-run stand in only 4.2 overs to cut the chase short."}
