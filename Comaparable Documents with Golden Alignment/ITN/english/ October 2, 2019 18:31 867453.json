{"Header": "Petitions against Gotabhaya taken up", "Time": " October 2, 2019 18:31 ", "Content": "The Controller of the Immigration and Emigration Department informed the court of appeal today that no document pertaining to the dual citizenship of Presidential candidate of the SLPP Gotabhaya Rajapakse is in his possession. Senior Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle who appeared on behalf of the Controller of the Immigration and Emigration Department said that the Department has computerized all the documents in 2007 and no document was destroyed. The Court of Appeals started hearing the petition regarding the citizenship of Presidential Candidate Gotabaya Rajapakse today. The petition is seeking for a writ of certiorari to be issued invalidating candidate’s passport, National Identity Card and dual citizenship certificate as his Sri Lankan nationality had not been secured in a proper way. Filing his preliminary objections Gotabhaya Rajapakse’s lawyer stated that the writ petition should not be considered until the conclusion of ongoing police investigation into the citizenship of Gotabhaya Rajapakse. Lawyer Suren Fernando appeared on behalf of petitioners stated that former President Mahinda Rajapakse won the election on 18th of November and before the 21st of November the certificate on dual citizenship was issued. The lawyer said that no Secretary had been appointed for the relevant Ministry at that time. As no Ministers or Secretaries had been appointed by the time of issuance of the dual citizenship certificate, the document should be invalid. The petition that has been filed by Prof. Chandragupta Thenuwara and Gamini Viyangoda challenging the validity of citizenship of Gotabhaya Rajapakse will be taken up again before the court of appeal at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow."}
