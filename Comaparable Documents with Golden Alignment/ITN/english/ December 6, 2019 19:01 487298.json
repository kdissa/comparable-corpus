He was speaking at a media briefing in Colombo today. Thilanga Sumathipala said that a nation in collapse has been handed over by the previous government. He noted that the country should be rebuilt as the development process that was initiated by the Rajapaksa Government was halted in the last five years. The Minister also responded to a query raised by media personnel as to whether the former President would contest the upcoming general election. Thilanga Sumathipala mentioned that the SLFP has already requested Maithripala Sirisena to contest the Parliamentary Election. Sri Lanka Freedom Party strongly believes that the former President would heed their request and provide the necessary guidance in the Polonnaruwa District."}
