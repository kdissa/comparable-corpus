The U.S. senator from Vermont rarely talked about his personal history during his first run for the White House in 2016 against eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, focusing almost exclusively on his policy plans to rein in Wall Street and reduce income inequality.But the new approach for Sanders, the son of a Jewish immigrant from Poland, was a recognition of the need to find a way to stand out in a crowded and diverse field of 2020 Democratic contenders, including five of his fellow senators."}
