Musicians carrying trumpets, trombones and other horn instruments played alongside percussionists as people danced and sang along. The director of the “Flying Orchestra” said that over the past several years upwards of 100,000 people participated in the party. Although Brazil has become globally famous for its glitzy Sambadrome parades, the traditional partying happens on the street. Rio de Janeiro’s Carnival officially began on March 01 and will last until March 06 during which time the city will receive hundreds of thousands of tourists who come to watch the parades and take part in raucous street parties known locally as “blocos.”"}
