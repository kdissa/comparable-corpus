Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in a shock referendum result, British politics is in crisis and it is unclear how, when or if it will ever leave the club it first joined in 1973. May’s deal has been defeated three times by the lower house of the British parliament which failed to find a majority of its own for any alternative to her deal. May is expected to try to put her deal to a fourth vote this week."}
