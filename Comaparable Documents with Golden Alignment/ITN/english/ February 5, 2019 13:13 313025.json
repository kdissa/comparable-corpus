The 73-year-old and his partner Ria have been living in poverty in southeastern Bulgaria for the last two months, only to receive help after his story grabbed huge attention in the Netherlands following a TV documentary. They survived freezing conditions in a broken-down van, lacking electricity, water and sanitary facilities, and looking after stray dogs, but Riaâ€™s health deteriorated suddenly and she was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Lubbers said her condition had improved slightly but she would remain in hospital for a few more days at least."}
