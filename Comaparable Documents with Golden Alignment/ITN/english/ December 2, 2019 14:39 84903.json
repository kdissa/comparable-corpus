The 34-year-old Mercedes driver led every lap from pole position to checkered flag, banging in a fastest lap for good measure to emphasise his supremacy under the Yas Marina floodlights. Red Bull’s Dutch driver Max Verstappen was runner-up, 16.7 seconds behind the Briton, to cement third place in the championship. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was third but in danger of disqualification for a fuel irregularity. Valtteri Bottas finished fourth for Mercedes after starting last on the grid due to engine penalties, with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel fifth."}
