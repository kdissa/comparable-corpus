Night Shyamalan. The film is a sequel to Shyamalan’s previous films Unbreakable and Split, cumulatively forming the Unbreakable series, also known as the Eastrail 177 Trilogy. Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Spencer Treat Clark, and Charlayne Woodard will be reprising their Unbreakable roles, while James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy will be returning as their Split characters,[6] with Sarah Paulson and Adam David Thompson joining the cast. While there was interest in creating a sequel to Unbreakable following its release, Touchstone Pictures opted not to finance one at that time despite the film’s solid box office performance. The film is scheduled to be released on January 18, 2019 by Universal Pictures in the United States and by Buena Vista International in international territories."}
