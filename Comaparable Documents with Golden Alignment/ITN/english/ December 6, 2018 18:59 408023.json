Seneviratne has said that the 19th Amendment has been made to include provisions needed for a United National Party Prime Minister to continuously remain in power. He made this reference at a media conference held at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Head Office at Nelum Mawatha. Parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene also expressed his views to the journalists. Parliamentarian W.D.J. Seneviratne attributed the political crisis within the country to the 19th Amendment brought forward by the 100-day Government. Provisions were included so that persons such as Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa cannot engage in politics in this country. Provisions were also included so that United National Party Prime Ministers could stay in power continuously. According to the Amendment Parliament cannot be dissolved until the completion of four and half years even if there was a social economic setback. This is being heard in the Supreme Court. The President has dissolved Parliament according to the powers vested in him. The 19th Amendment has been crafted according to the wishes of Ranil Wickremasinghe. He mentioned that the appointment of the Prime Minister on the 26 of October could have been taken to Courts. But it was not done. Parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene said that in Parliament yesterday the so called agenda contained a motion expressing confidence in Ranil Wickremasinghe. This motion which was presented by Mayantha Dissanayake was withdrawn. He said that the cause for the withdrawal of the motion was the presence of a group of Parliamentarians who would not express their confidence for Ranil Wickremsinghe. As such it was withdrawn and yesterdayâ€™s sittings were held without an agenda."}
