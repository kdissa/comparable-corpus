The local winners from the host village Coxheath, near Maidstone in Kent, beat 31 other teams from all over the UK, including three from Japan. Japanese runners-up, ‘Do You Like Sushi?’ included members currently living in the UK, but team ‘Kyoto’ flew in from the Japanese city on the island of Honshu especially, as the event is a “very famous festival in Japan” and they wanted to have fun. Other teams included members dressed as the Minions, The Spice Girls and even shower curtains."}
