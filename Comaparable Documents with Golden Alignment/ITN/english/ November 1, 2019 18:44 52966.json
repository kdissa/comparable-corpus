Presidential candidate of the National People’s Power Force made this reference at a people’s rally held in the Chilaw town. A large gathering including party activists joined in this gathering organized to consolidate the victory of Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake said it is awfully unfair that parliamentarians should receive a pension just after serving five years in Parliament. He pointed out that even the farmers who toil hard throughout their lives do not receive a pension. He said they will immediately abolish the pension scheme for the parliamentarians and halt the maintenance of former presidents at the expense of tax payers. He said the vile political culture that prevailed for 71 years has left wealthy politicians and an impoverished nation."}
