As the bell tolled 8:15 am, the precise time when the U.S. warplane dropped the atomic bomb, 50,000 participants including ageing survivors held a moment of silence at an annual memorial ceremony under the intense summer heat. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who also participated in the ceremony, repeated the usual vows to lead efforts for a nuclear-free world. The United States dropped the bomb in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, killing thousands of people instantly and about 140,000 by the end of that year."}
