Expressing his views from Jamaica Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa said that under the 19th Amendment, the President has the total legal Constitutional authority to make such an appointment. The Executive Presidency still prevails in the country. Before the 19th Amendment was brought forward it was taken up in the Supreme Court. In that instance it was mentioned that the President’s power was to be vested in the Prime Minister. But the Apex Court said that if such powers of the President was to be vested in the Prime Minister a two thirds majority in Parliament was required in addition to holding a referendum. Still the President is also the head of the Cabinet."}
