With water rising to rooftops and submerging cars as the Russian River burst its banks, authorities in Sonoma County, about 70 miles north of San Francisco, ordered 3,600 people to evacuate on Tuesday. Some people who stayed used kayaks to traverse flooded streets. By Thursday, National Guard troops, along with state and local responders, had used high water vehicles to rescue nearly 60 people, Sonoma County officials said. A National Weather Service (NWS) flood warning remained in effect for the rain-soaked area on Thursday and at least 20 roads in the Russian River valley, including sections of two highways, were still closed."}
