Kohli said he had matured as a person and was not affected by criticism of his performance in the four years since India’s 3-1 series defeat by England.England won the one-day international series between the teams 2-1 and lost the Twenty20 competition by the same margin this month. Kohli refused to say whether his team were the underdogs or the favourites. India last won a test series in England in 2007, while the hosts are looking for their first series win in four. England captain Joe Root said his team was ready to rise to the challenge of taking on India."}
