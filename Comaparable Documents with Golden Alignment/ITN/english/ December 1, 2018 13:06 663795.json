The recording will help researchers at the University of Portsmouth’s Institue of Marine Sciences (IMS) study the impact of noise pollution on the marine environment and whether the remotest areas of the world’s oceans remain unaffected by man-made noise.The recording equipment will capture two minutes of audio out of every 5 minutes all the way round, storing it on a 2TB hard drive."}
