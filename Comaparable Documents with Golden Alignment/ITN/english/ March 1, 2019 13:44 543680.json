He said they asked only for partial sanctions relief, not a total lifting. But the Trump administration insists the North demanded a complete lifting of the measures, saying there was no clarity about what they had to offer.After their talks broke down, Mr Trump said Mr Kim had offered to dismantle all of the Yongbyon complex, the research and production facility at the heart of North Korea’s nuclear programme, a significant proposal. But in return Mr Kim wanted all sanctions lifted, something the US was not prepared to offer, Mr Trump added."}
