Team mate Valtteri Bottas qualified second but will start at the back of the grid due to engine penalties, meaning that Red Bull’s Max Verstappen will join the Briton on the front row. The pole was Hamilton’s first since Germany in July, a run of nine races without starting from the top slot, but his fifth in Abu Dhabi and 88th of his career. Hamilton has won four times previously at the Yas Marina circuit and is chasing his 11th victory of the season on Sunday to end the campaign just seven off Michael Schumacher’s all-time record of 91."}
