The British lawn mower racing season gets off to a perfect start", "Time": " May 6, 2019 13:42 ", "Content": "For some dedicated petrol-heads the wait was finally over as the British Lawnmower racing championships commenced. The cutting edge sport took place on a large, grassy race track in the village of Billinghurst in West Sussex. There are four race categories depending on the type of lawn mower ranging from roller driven mowers with seats to wheel driven varieties. For safety reasons the mower blades are removed for racing but the engine is retained. According to the British Lawn Mower Racing Association, lawn mower racing began in 1973."}
