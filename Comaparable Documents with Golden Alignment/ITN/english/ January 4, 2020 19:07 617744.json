Dr.HarithaAluthge said that they have submitted enough details to 11 places during the past four and half years as to why Rajitha Senarathne should be considered a respondent to the harm caused to the general public of the country. He said that it is unfortunate that none of those places has given a positive response. He said that enough accusations have been levelled against former Minister Rajitha Senarathne for the harm caused to the health of the public. He pointed out that the malpractice committed at the Nevil Fernando Hospital runs into billions of rupees. Dr.Aluthge said that former Minister Senarathne should take total responsibility as the person who made the Cabinet submission. He said that they are watching, what is the difficulty in taking legal action against him under the Public Property Act, Bribery Act and Penal Code in connection with the transaction at the Nevil Fernando Hospital. He said that they have decided to handover more than 30 files handed over to those 11 places to the President with a covering letter next week."}
