Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has called all the Parliamentarians who support the Government to his office this morning. It was to discuss several decisions. Party Leaders and a majority of Parliamentarians were present at the meeting. The Prime Minister’s Media Secretary said that lengthy discussions took place on future course of action. Mr. Rambukwella said that the government can show a majority in Parliament by now. He said that the parliament will meet ceremonially on the first day and the agenda will be prepared after that.
