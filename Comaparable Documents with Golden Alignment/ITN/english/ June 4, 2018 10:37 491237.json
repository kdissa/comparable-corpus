Guests arrived from Parisian streets carrying tables, chairs and baskets full of fine food and wine. The exclusive, invite-only “Diner en Blanc” or “Dinner in White” in English is organised every year with the location remaining a closely guarded secret until the last minute to keep diners and the authorities in the dark. Organisers say whilst they are not officially allowed to organise a dinner, they are allowed to hold an improvised picnic hence the all-important secrecy. But the event does not look like a makeshift affair, with thousands dressed to impress sitting at tables covered in crisp white tablecloths and crowned with candelabras."}
