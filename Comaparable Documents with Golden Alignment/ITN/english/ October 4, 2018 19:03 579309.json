Support was received for this programme from the Armed Forces, the Civil Defence Force, the Katunayake and Seeduwa Urban Councils and the Katana Pradeshiya Sabha. Officers of the Medical Office of Health as well as many civil organizations extended support for the cleaning process. Many people also assisted in this task. The Project came in for acclamation by a majority. Many programmes to keep the environment clean are planned without limiting it to the removal of garbage. Plans are afoot to building a pleasant environment with greenery as another future step on the Clean & Green City Project."}
