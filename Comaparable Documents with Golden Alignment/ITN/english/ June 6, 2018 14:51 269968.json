Biorobotics Professor Andy Philippides’s team plans to design an autonomous flying robot with the navigational and learning abilities displayed by the two highly intelligent forms of insects. The four-year project called ‘Brains on Board’ involves researchers from the University of Sheffield and Queen Mary University of London. Commercial partners Nvidia have created small GPU chips and tiny Jetson boards which the team will fit the unmanned aerial vehicles onto. Dewar says that creating such a computationally and energy-efficient autonomous robot would represent a step-change in robotics technology."}
