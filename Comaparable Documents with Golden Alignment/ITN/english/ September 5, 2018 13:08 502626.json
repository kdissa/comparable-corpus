The Surf Ranch Pro makes its debut in the World Surf League and will see competitors tackle artificial waves for the first time on the Championship Tour. A new leaderboard style format will take place for the new event with surfers earning scores for ‘runs’ as opposed to standard heats. The four surfers in contention for the title of World Champion, Brazilian pair Filipe Toledo and Gabriel Medina were joined by Australia’s Julian Wilson and Brazil’s Italo Ferreira at the new Surf Ranch to practice ahead of the event."}
