The sensors monitor the animal’s heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate and blood pressure.Live data can then be sent to a tablet for owners, trainers, veterinarians or others to analyse. Existing equine-monitoring equipment typically does not work while the animal is moving and is designed for owners’ use only, the University of Bath says. EquiVi allows the horse to be monitored while in a stable, traveling, while receiving medical care and during exercise, the university adds. Using the data, the hope is a profile can be built of each horse."}
