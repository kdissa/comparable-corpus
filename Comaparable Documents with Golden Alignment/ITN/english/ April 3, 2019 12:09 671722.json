The villages were close to the Dez and Karkheh rivers. At least 47 people were killed in the past two weeks in flash floods in various provinces in Iran, from north to south, after the heaviest rains in the country in at least a decade. Iran has announced a state of emergency in several provinces threatened by flooding and tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes in the flood-hit provinces, where dozens of villages have been evacuated already. Officials in Tehran have called on people to stay away from rivers and areas near dams, saying that all the relevant organisations were on high-alert due to possibility of flooding in the capital."}
