The only risk to Jones came in the closing seconds of the fourth round when he landed an illegal left knee to the head of Smith, who had one hand on the ground. The challenger would have been awarded a win by disqualification if he told the referee he was unable to continue, but he fought on before ultimately dropping the decision.Nigerian-born Kamaru Usman dominated the co-main event, backing Woodley up against the fence and ripping dozens of thunderous shots to the body, and then taking his opponent to the mat at will."}
