But the air remained at the “hazardous” level in the teeming capital of more than 20 million people, more than five times the recommended safe limit of 60. According to the U.S. Embassy’s real-time air quality index, levels of airborne PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that can reach deep into the lungs, were at 331. Meanwhile, authorities in India’s northern Uttar Pradesh state deployed air purifiers to protect the historic Taj Mahal monument. In Agra, home to the Taj Mahal and one of the world’s most polluted cities, officials have rolled out two air purifier vans that can purify 15 lakh cubic metres of air in eight hours. Pollution is turning the Taj Mahal yellow, despite efforts by the Indian government to control air contamination around the poignant 17th century monument and keep it shimmering white."}
