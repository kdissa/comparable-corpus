Sri Lanka received a boost from opener Danushka Gunathilaka who struck a half century as Sri Lanka posted 165 for the loss of 5 wickets. Chasing a modest victory target of 166, skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed and his charges were all bundled out at 101 in 17.4 overs. The stunning victory gave the visitors 1-Nil lead in the three-match series."}
