One man shot dead, his body carried away by fellow protesters, when security forces opened fire with live rounds on demonstrators near Baghdadâ€™s Ahrar Bridge. However, security and medical sources put the toll at one dead and 22 wounded, adding that rubber bullets and tear gas, not live ammunition, were used. The Interior Ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. More than 250 Iraqis have been killed in demonstrations since the start of October against a government they see as corrupt and beholden to foreign interests."}
