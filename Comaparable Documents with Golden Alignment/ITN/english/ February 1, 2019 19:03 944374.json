They are Tamils who had left their motherland during the war period. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees had provided them the necessary facilities. The Government has taken all necessary measures to build peace and reconciliation among all Sri Lankans. Accordingly the Government extended an open invitation to all citizens who left the island during the war period to return to their motherland. It is in response to this request that the United Nations High Commission provided facilities for the Tamil civilians who are returning home on a voluntary basis. The High Commission provided them free air tickets. More than eleven thousand Tamil civilians who had been residing in Camps in Tamil Nadu have already returned to the island. The High Commission for Refugees said that a group comprising more than 3800 had already expressed their willingness to return to Sri Lanka. Action has been taken to resettle such returnees in the Districts of Vavuniya, Mannar, Matale, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee."}
