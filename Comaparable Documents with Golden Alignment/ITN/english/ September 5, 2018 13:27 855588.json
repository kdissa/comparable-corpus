Libya is a major departure point in North Africa for migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, mainly from other parts of Africa.Most of these migrants were jailed after the Libyan coast guard intercepted their makeshift boats bound for Italy.With fighting entering its second week, the United Nations said earlier on Tuesday that a ceasefire between armed factions had been reached. It was not clear how the ceasefire would be implemented as militias have ignored previous calls to lay down arms by the U.N.-backed government."}
