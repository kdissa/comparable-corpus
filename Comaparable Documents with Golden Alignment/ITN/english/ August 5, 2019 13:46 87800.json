With all the facilities in working order, the zoo conducted its first test run Saturday night. In the zoo, illuminated by diffused light that simulates natural moonlight, the animals feed and play at ease. The tigers jump to catch meat hanging above them and then drop into a pool of water, sparking cheers from the crowd of visitors time and time again. Smaller animals like fennec foxes and raccoons tend to be much quieter. They appear to enjoy the cool evening very much, having some of their favorite foods and even doing some nocturnal exercises."}
