Wawrinka beat fellow Swiss Federer at the same stage four years ago on his way to winning the title, but this time came up just short as Federer won 7-6(4) 4-6 7-6(5) 6-4. Federer, 37, is the oldest man to reach the French Open semi-finals since Pancho Gonzales got there aged 40 in 1968 but will need to find a way to beat French Open nemesis Rafael Nadal if his quest for a second title in Paris is to continue. They will meet on Friday for the 39th time with Nadal having won all of their previous five French Open duels."}
