His comments followed the US assassination of Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian general, in a drone strike. Trump wrote on Twitter that Iran “is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets” in response to the general’s death. Meanwhile, anti-war protesters in Los Angeles chanted slogans and held up posters that read “No War on Iran” The protest came as tens of thousands of people marched in Iraq to mourn Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia leader who were killed in the U.S. air strike. The United States is sending nearly 3,000 additional troops to the Middle East from the 82nd Airborne Division as a precaution amid rising threats to American forces in the region. In the meantime, tens of thousands of people marched in Baghdad to mourn Iran’s military chief Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, killed in a U.S. air strike that has raised the specter of wider conflict in the Middle East. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards said Tehran would punish Americans “wherever they are in reach,” and raised the prospect of possible attacks on ships in the Gulf. Mourners carried portraits of both men and plastered them on walls and armored personnel carriers in the procession, and chanted, “Death to America” and “No No Israel.”"}
