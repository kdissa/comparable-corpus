Two-time winners India – the last team to get their campaign under way, with the tournament a week old – put together a complete performance with bat and ball in front of a sold-out Southampton crowd of more than 18,500 after losing the toss.While captain and star attraction Virat Kohli may have only made 18, brilliantly caught by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, Rohit showed patience and control in his 144-ball stay at the crease, including 13 fours and two sixes.On another difficult day for South Africa, they dropped a seemingly regulation catch offered by Rohit on 107 as David Miller put him down at extra cover off Kagiso Rabada."}
