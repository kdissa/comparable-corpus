The State Minister said that parliamentarian, Bandula Gunawardena has equaled the Sri Lanka- Singapore free trade agreement to the pact signed with the English in 1815. Dr. Harsha De Silva said that such agreements were signed by the previous government not the current government. He was speaking at a media briefing held at the Sirikotha party headquarters, today. The State Minister explained that if the free trade agreement is not beneficial to Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan party is entitled to withdraw from the agreement as per the clauses included in itself. He highlighted that assigning the land block of the Army headquarters is similar to the conventions signed with the English and the Sri Lankan government will not be able to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that the current government was able to even amend the Port City agreement as well. He said that previous government had entered into an agreement to sell out 50 acres in front of the President’s Office. Dr. Harsha De Silva emphasized that no such fate will be experienced by Sri Lanka due to the Sri Lanka-Singapore free trade agreement. During the past regime, a large number of Chinese manpower was imported into Sri Lanka. The Minister said that nobody questioned the previous government’s move to bring Chinese nationals including Chinese prisoners to construction industries in the island nation. He said that the previous government sponsored such acts."}
