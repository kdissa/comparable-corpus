The employee had accused she was detained and intimidated to obtain information about the Swiss embassy. Accordingly, the Government of Sri Lanka decided to conduct an immediate investigation into the incident. The investigations were entrusted to the CID. However, the CID made an attempt to record a statement from her regarding the allegation but she did not respond. The Foreign Secretary and the Defense Secretary also met with the Swiss Ambassador in Sri Lanka to urge him to assist the investigations. However, the CID informed the court that if she would go abroad without giving a statement to the police, it would hamper the ongoing investigations. Accordingly Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne issued the order preventing her from going abroad until the 9th of next month."}
