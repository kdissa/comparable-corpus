Messi set alarm bells off after sustaining a knock to his calf during Saturday’s 2-2 La Liga draw with Valencia, although he was able to finish the game after being treated, with Barca not releasing a medical report on his condition. Speaking ahead of Wednesday’s game at the Nou Camp, Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said he would see how Messi responded in training, but that he would take no risks with the club’s all-time top scorer.
