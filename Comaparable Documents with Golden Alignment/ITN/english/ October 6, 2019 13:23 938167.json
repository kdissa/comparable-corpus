Earlier, North Korea said the meeting had broken down, because the US brought “nothing to the negotiation table”. Officials from the two countries met in Sweden in the hope of breaking their stalemate. This came just days after North Korea tested a new missile, in a significant advance on earlier tests. The meeting was the first formal working-level discussion since US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met briefly at the inter-Korean border zone in June."}
