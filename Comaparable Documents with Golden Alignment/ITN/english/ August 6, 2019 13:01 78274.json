Protesters blocked roads and paralysed train services at peak times on a day of action across the city. More than 200 flights were cancelled as the protests entered their ninth week. Hong Kongâ€™s leader, Carrie Lam, has pledged to restore law and order, rejecting calls for her resignation. Initially the demonstrations, which began on 9 June, focused on a controversial extradition law, which would have allowed the transfer of suspects to mainland China."}
