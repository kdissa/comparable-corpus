Striker Werner struck in the third minute and then again deep in first-half stoppage time to take his league tally to eight goals as the hosts outclassed Gladbach, who were on a three-game winning run. Gladbach mislaid their attacking game and, apart from Lars Stindlâ€™s deflected shot that hit the bar in the 75th minute, they rarely threatened after the break. Unbeaten at home this season, Leipzig also kept a fifth consecutive clean sheet at home and moved to 25 points into third place, a point ahead of champions Bayern Munich, and one behind Gladbach."}
