Groups rallied in the Mong Kok district before starting their march. They called on others to join a city-wide strike planned. Beijing and the Chinese army have issued stern warnings about the unrest. Two months of demonstrations sparked by a controversial extradition bill show no signs of abating, with both sides hardening their stance. Although the government has now suspended the bill, which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, demonstrators want the bill fully withdrawn."}
