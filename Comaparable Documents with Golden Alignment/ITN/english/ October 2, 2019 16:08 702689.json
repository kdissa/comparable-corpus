The showman Lyles, his hair dyed silver after a heroic animee character, won the first of what many predict will be many world championship medals by storming across the line unthreatened in a time off 19.83 seconds. Sam Kendricks of the United States clinched his second consecutive world title after a duel with European champion Armand Duplantis that electrified the usually muted crowd at Khalifa International Stadium. Kendricks stayed alive by clearing 5.87 and 5.97 metres in his third and final attempts. Kelsey-Lee Barber won Australia’s first javalin gold at a world championships after unleashing a throw of 66.56m, the best of the evening. Shiying Liu and Huihui Lyu of China took silver and bronze, respectively."}
