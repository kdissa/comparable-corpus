Germany international Leon Goretzka headed in a Thomas Mueller’s cross after 40 minutes to put Bayern ahead with his fourth goal in the last three league games. In first half injury time, Robert Lewandowski thought he had put Bayern 2-0 up, but his goal was disallowed for offside following a VAR review. Peter Bosz’ attack-minded Leverkusen responded with three goals in the second half. Leon Bailey put Leverkusen level after 52 minutes with a brilliant free-kick, and then ten minutes later, Kevin Volland completed a stunning break that caught Bayern’s defence napping to secure the lead."}
