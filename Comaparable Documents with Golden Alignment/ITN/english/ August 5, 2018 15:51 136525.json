Lack of awareness, information about general hygiene, access to proper medical facilities and nutritious food are some of the reasons that causes malnutrition in children leading to deaths at times. The area, reportedly, has been neglected by the government causing the problem to prevail for a long time. Amravati Collector Abhijit Bangar said the maximum number of cases of infant deaths was reported during the months of monsoon. Meanwhile, flood waters swept through cities located along India’s Ganges River, wreaking havoc for residents of the country’s northern Uttar Pradesh state. Footage showed severe water-logging in various parts of the industrial city of Kanpur and the temple town of Varanasi. Uttar Pradesh state chief, Yogi Adityanath, conducted an aerial survey of flood hit areas on Saturday and announced that facilities had been put in place to help civilians affected by the high water."}
