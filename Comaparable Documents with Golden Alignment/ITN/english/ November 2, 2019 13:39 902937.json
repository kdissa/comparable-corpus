The Serb, who will be supplanted as world number one by Rafael Nadal, showed no signs of the cold that bothered him in his first two rounds as he produced a brilliant display that lasted less than an hour.He will next face Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, whose solid run at Bercy continued when he saw off Chileâ€™s Cristian Garin 6-2 7-5.Djokovic, a 16-time grand slam champion, raced through the first set and came close to handing Greek seventh seed Tsitsipas a bagel as he set up three set points at 5-0.Tsitsipas saved them but then surrendered the set with some awful shots. After securing an early break in the second set, Djokovic did not look back as he avenged his quarter-final loss to the Greek in the quarter-finals of the Shanghai Masters this year.Earlier Dimitrov, who had been struggling since being beaten in the U.S. Open semi-final in September, overcame a second-set wobble to reach the last four."}
