Syed Hussain Abid’s idea is to use existing technology to make the fuel, in the process creating a new market for the 50 million tonnes of straw left after the annual wheat harvest. Called Al-Barr, which means infinity in Arabic, the system envisages an income stream for straw along with hybrid vehicles and stoves to use the fuel. Many farmers in Pakistan are not only poor but also have a very low standard of living, some using cow dung as a fuel to cook with."}
