Nicolas Ghesquière, the artistic director of the brand’s women’s wear, displayed its Spring-Summer 2020 collection in a stripped-back space built in the Louvre’s courtyard. Celebrity couple Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel were joined by Jennifer Connelly and Alicia Vikander in the front row. The catwalk was dominated by art nouveau prints, flare pants and three-piece suits evokating the fashion game in the 1970s."}
