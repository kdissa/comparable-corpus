An official statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lu Kang said China is utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the move. It said that both Canada and the U.S. are abusing their bilateral extradition treaty. It also said that taking arbitrary coercive measures against Chinese citizens is a severe violation of Chinese citizens’ lawful rights. This is a serious political incident. China has again urged the U.S. to immediately withdraw the warrant and extradition request against Meng, and is urging Canada to release her immediately."}
