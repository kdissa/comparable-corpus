The Jamaican eight-time Olympic sprint champion, 32, joined the A-League side for an “indefinite training period” in August. He scored two goals in his first effort for the Mariners in a friendly, but did not play matches when the season began. Efforts to secure a “commercial solution” to keep Bolt at the club had failed. Last month, the Mariners said they had made a contract proposal broken down into “football” and “commercial” terms. However, it hinged on a contribution from a “third party”. Bolt, who retired from athletics in 2017, has previously trained with Borussia Dortmund, South African club Mamelodi Sundowns and Norway’s Stromsgodset."}
