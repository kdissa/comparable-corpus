Doctors have been surprised by Mariame and Ndeye’s progress, discovering that the closely linked circulatory systems that make it impossible to separate them is also the reason they have continued to thrive, as both girls are mutually dependent on each other. The twins’ father, Ibrahima Ndiaye, originally brought his daughters to the UK in the hope they would get a better life."}
