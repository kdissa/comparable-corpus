Having fled war in Somalia, Aden is part of a small band of refugees who have taken up the fight against the plastic waste generated in Dadaab and also earns an income from it. Dadaab’s waste recycling project, set up by the Kenya Red Cross Society just over a year ago, has only eight refugee staff. But initial results are promising, and the plan is to grow. In a cement-and-iron building equipped with a plastic shredder and compressor, the refugees have recycled about six tonnes of plastic waste so far, generating some $1,580 in revenue."}
