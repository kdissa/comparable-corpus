The U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton on Wednesday confirmed that the United States will withdraw from the treaty on Friday, adding that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the last remaining arms control agreement, is flawed and therefore unlikely to be extended. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Thursday said the United States is actively looking for excuses to pull out of the international treaties that they signed before. During an interview on Wednesday, Ryabkov said that Russia would not rule out similar measures if the United States moved missiles banned by the INF treaty closer to Russia, so as to balance the time it takes for the missiles to reach the other country."}
