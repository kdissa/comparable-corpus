Workers from agricultural companies around the country dashed around the race-course at speeds of up to 100 km/h as visitors to the 17th Bizon track show sheltered under trees and parasols from the baking heat. Spectators held their breath when one of the tractors hit a haystack on the side of the track and caused several journalists to scramble out of the way, but luckily no one was hurt. The Bizon track show winner, Vyacheslav Mironov, a driver from Moscow region, received a brand new Ant-Zetor 4135F tractor."}
