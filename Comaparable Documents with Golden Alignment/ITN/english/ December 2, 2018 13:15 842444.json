The civil code will be updated to state that parental authority must be exercised without violence and that parents may not resort to “physical, verbal or psychological violence, nor to corporal punishment or humiliation”. The ban was approved in a thinly-attended National Assembly in a session that began late Thursday evening, with 51 votes in favour, one against and three abstentions. It reverses parental rights to discipline children using corporal punishment granted under Napoleon in the early 1800s."}
