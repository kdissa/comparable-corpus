The operations to raise the sunken bus started at about 21:30. The bus was pulled out of water by a floating crane at about 23:30 after a one-minute silence with sirens wailed. The black box recording device from the bus was retrieved and handed over to the local public security bureau earlier on Wednesday morning. The bus veered onto the wrong side of the road and collided into an oncoming car before breaking through road fencing and falling off a bridge in Chongqing’s Wanzhou District on Sunday. A previous investigation said that 15 people including the bus driver were on board. Nine bodies have been retrieved so far."}
