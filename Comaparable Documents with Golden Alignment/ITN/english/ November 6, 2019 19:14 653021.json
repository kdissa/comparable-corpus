The Kalu Ganga Reservoir Project comes under the mega Moragahakanda â€“ Kalu Ganga Multi-Purpose Development Project, considered to be the irrigation marvel of the 21st Century. The water capacity of the Kalu Ganga Reservoir is 248 million cubic meters and the length and the height of the main dam is 618 meters and 68 meters respectively. The project will meet the water demands of 3000 families who have been resettled at the lower valley of Kalu ganga. It will supply water to nurture 2000 acres of irrigation land and the excess water will be released to Moragahakanda reservoir. A 9- meter long canal has been constructed for this purpose. The project will be instrumental in developing agricultural activities by increasing the water supply to old Amban Ganga, Yodha Ela via Minneriya, Giritale, Kawudulla and Kantale. In addition, this will also enable 40,000 families to cultivate in both Yala and Maha seasons."}
