The Parliamentarian expressed these views at the meeting of the Rathgama Electoral Seat of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. MP Dallas Alahapperuma said that on March 1960 after assassination of Prime Minister Bandaranayake, Speaker T.B. Subasinghe did not say the government could not continue without a majority. In 2004 General Election under the leadership of Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga there were only 105 members and the government candidate Dew Gunasekara lost the vote to become the Speaker. Mr. W.J.M. Lokubandara became the Speaker who was the Senior Deputy Chairman of the UNP. He did not say that he will appoint committees according to his wishes as the government did not have a majority. In 2015 Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe who had 44 members was appointed as the Prime Minister. There were 126 members of the SLFP. He said that there was no record in the world history that a Prime Minister was appointed who did not have even Â¼ members in Parliament. But the Speaker was Mr. Chamal Rajapaksa who was the senior Deputy Chairman of SLFP. Implementing the Order of the President he gave a majority of members of the Select Committees and allowed Mr. Wickremasingh to continue with the Government."}
