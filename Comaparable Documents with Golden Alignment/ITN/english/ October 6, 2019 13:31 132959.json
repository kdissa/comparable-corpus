Ten of the 13 bishops elevated to the high rank are under the age of 80 and so are eligible to vote in a conclave to elect a new pope from their ranks. Francis has now appointed more than half of the 128 cardinal electors, increasing the possibility that the next pope will continue his progressive policies. Over six years he has appointed more cardinal electors than those still alive who were named by former Pope Benedict and the late Pope John Paul combined."}
