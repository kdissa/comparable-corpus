{"Header": "Roger Federer and Serena Williams win on Wimbledon day one", "Time": " July 3, 2018 18:00 ", "Content": "Serena Williams swapped the skin-tight catsuit that caused a stir at the French Open for a more conservative look as she marked her return to Wimbledon for the first time since becoming a mother with a 7-5 6-3 first-round win over Arantxa Rus. The seven-time champion, who missed last year’s tournament while pregnant with her daughter Alexis Olympia is considered by many as the woman to beat at these championships despite her lowly ranking of 181. Wimbledon men’s champion Roger Federer began the defence of his crown with an easy 6-1 6-3 6-4 victory over Serbia’s Dusan Lajovic on Centre Court. Wearing new Uniqlo clothing instead of his usual Nike shirt, shorts and headband, Switzerland’s Federer took just an hour and 19 minutes to beat the man he also defeated on his way to last year’s title."}
