Eight-month-old Luna took part in a news conference alongside her mother Carol Fenner and Russian doctor Pavel Popov, who specialises in skin disorders. During the first course of treatment, Luna underwent a series of procedures to remove a congenital melanocytic nevus from her forehead and the edges of her eyelids. The condition causes abnormally dark blemishes and is associated with higher risks of developing skin cancer."}
