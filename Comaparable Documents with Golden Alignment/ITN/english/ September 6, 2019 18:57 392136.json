The Consumer Affairs Authority said that the Prima Company has increased the price of wheat flour without its approval. The Prima Company has informed its marketing agents that it was increasing the price of a kilogramme of wheat flour by five rupees and fifty cents with effect from today. The Bakery Owners Association said that accordingly they would be increasing the price of a loaf of bread by two rupees. Meanwhile the Consumer Protection Association has called upon the Consumer Affairs Authority to take suitable action against the price increase that has been effected without proper approval. A maximum price has been stipulated for wheat flour in an extra ordinary gazette notification issued on 14th July 2016 and if so a price increase is to be effected the approval of the Consumer Affairs Authority has to be obtained. Increasing the price of wheat flour sans its approval is illegal. As such the Consumer Protection Organization further requests to take suitable legal action against the Company concerned."}
