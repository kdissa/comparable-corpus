This programme is being organized with the intention of educating school children, young men and women and the community on the new trends in the day to day changing labour market and higher education needs. It is being launched under the guidance of Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Expressing his views at the opening the Education Minister said that the aim of organizing this exhibition was to provide a guidance to the young men and women after their Advanced Level Examination. A section of students who sit the G.C.E. Ordinary and Advanced Level Examinations follow educational courses or vocational training courses. But it has been found that a majority of the students are unaware of the standards of these courses. The aim of this exhibition is to guide the students on the correct path. Due to the lack of proper training young men and women have to market their abilities for a lesser price. This cannot prevent the impact it has on the economy and society. The “Nineteen Plus Victorious Path Education, Vocational and Guidance Exhibition is planned to be organized as a countrywide programme. Accordingly attention has been drawn to implementing this exhibition as an islandwide programme. Many state, semi state and private establishments are involved in this Exhibition."}
