Veteran Malinga and Pandya picked three wickets each while Behrendorff, making his IPL debut, scalped two wickets to help the hosts register a 37 runs victory. The bowlers displayed a brilliant performance after Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard’s quick-fire knock propelled Mumbai Indians to 170/5.Chasing the target, Chennai started on a poor note, losing openers Ambati Rayudu and Shane Watson cheaply.
