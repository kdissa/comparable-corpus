The India captain, who has moved to the top of the International Cricket Council rankings, scored 149 not out in the first innings and 51 in the second. Kohli has ended former Australia skipper Steve Smith’s 32-month reign as the top Test batsman. Smith is currently serving a 12-month international ban for ball-tampering. Kohli, who has scored 22 tons in 67 matches, said his first century in England “does not matter” after defeat. He is the first Indian to top the rankings since Sachin Tendulkar in June 2011."}
