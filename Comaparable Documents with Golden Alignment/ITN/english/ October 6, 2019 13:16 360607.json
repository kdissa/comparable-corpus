Demonstrators say they are taking a stand against unemployment, poor public services and corruption in the country. Head of the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq said those responsible for the loss of life should be brought to justice. Five people are said to have died in the latest clashes in the capital. Security forces are again reported to have used live rounds and tear gas. The Iraqi parliament’s human rights commission said at least 99 people had died and nearly 4,000 had been wounded since protests began in the capital before spreading to the south of Iraq."}
