More than 500 brands have brought their products to the international motor show and that number doubles in comparison with that of last time. But some well-known brands, namely, Volkswagen, Ford, Volvo have chosen not to attend. The absence of those famous brands have raised some doubts that the high cost for attending the motor show and the punitive tariffs that the U.S. threated to levy on imports of European vehicles should be blamed. Jean Claude Girot, general manager of the Paris Motor Show said he has not felt the impact of trade tensions on the show, but will worry a lot if the exhibitors’ sales and expansion are affected. According to Girot, some brands from China and Vietnam will be the highlights of this year’s show and he also foresees a bright future of Chinese brands in the European market, especially after seeing some new products from Chinese auto makers, including the SUV GS5, an all-new product of GAC Motor, China’s leading auto maker."}
