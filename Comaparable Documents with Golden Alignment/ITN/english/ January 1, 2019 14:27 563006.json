A plague of the ‘vespa velutina’ has steadily been taking over much of the Iberian Peninsula since entering Spanish air space in 2010. The honeybee-keeping industry has been seriously affected by their presence, while butterfly numbers are also down.President of The Asian Hornet Association, firefighter, Saul Peña, told Reuters: “For the nests located at an inaccessible height, we use this drone. We fill the projectiles with the requisite chemicals, fly in front of the nest, at 10 or 15 metres distance, and shoot the projectiles. We have a success rate of close to a hundred per cent.”The Asian Hornet Association also organises summits with experts and hold courses to teach fire-fighters how to neutralise nests."}
