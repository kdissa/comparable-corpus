Given a tough score to overturn by Japanese surfer Hinako Kurokawa, the seven-time WSL champion showed all her class and experience, scoring 6.60 on her second wave.Although the event has been downgraded from the World Tour to a QS 10,000, the event is still worth 30,000USD to the winner, the same as for the menâ€™s event. This is following an initiative undertaken by the World Surf League, which began at the start of this season, for equal prize money for men and women for all of its events."}
