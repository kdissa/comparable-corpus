Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera instructed officials to carry out this work in collaboration with the Air Force. By now, many paddy lands are cultivated with other crops such as banana and papaya. Some have begun to reclaim paddy lands and undertake new constructions. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture does not have the correct information about paddy lands. However, the lack of correct information in the affairs of providing fertilizer subsidy is a problem. Accordingly, a mapping program will be launched to get accurate information about the paddy fields in the country."}
