The young Monegasque’s time of one minute 16.231 seconds was a talking point on a sunny day at the Circuit de Catalunya, confirming Ferrari’s status as early frontrunners, while Frenchman Pierre Gasly had a heavy crash in his Red Bull.The penultimate day of testing, before teams head back to their factories and on to Australia for the March 17 season-opener, saw another high-speed incident when Gasly went off at turn nine. The Frenchman, who has moved up from Toro Rosso to replace departed Australian Daniel Ricciardo, was unhurt but the impact did considerable damage to the car and ended the team’s programme for the day.Lapping in ambient temperatures of 21 degrees Celsius, Leclerc went more than half a second faster than the best of the rest on the softest, and fastest, C5 compound tyres in the morning session.He later stopped on track with an exhaust issue but the overall tone emanating from the team was upbeat."}
