The video was accompanied with a description saying the boys, aged between 11 and 16, ate “power meal” inside the cave and had a medical checkup with a Navy medic. The boys were seen identifying themselves and sending their greetings to their family members and the public. The twelve boys and their soccer coach were found alive after ten days trapped deep inside the flooded Tham Luang cave complex. Seven members of the Thai Navy SEAL team are staying with the trapped boys, according to the SEAL commander. Rescuers now have to decide how best to get the group out in their weakened condition. Options being considered include waiting until water levels subside, or teaching the group to use diving gear to navigate the flooded cave."}
