The drugs were busted overnight after the ship, which was travelling to Morocco from South America, docked in Cape Verde’s Port of Praia for legal reasons following the death of a crew member. The judicial police said it was alerted by the Maritime Analysis and Operation Center – a platform coordinating the anti-drug trafficking actions of seven E.U. states – who suspected the ship of transporting illicit substances. They seized 9.5 tonnes of cocaine and arrested 11 Russian nationals. The use of hard substances like cocaine, heroin and amphetamines is rising in West Africa, where countries that once served primarily as transit points for trade between South America and Europe are now active consumer markets. Despite strict drug laws, the quantity of cocaine seized in Africa doubled in 2016, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, making it the second-highest growth in cocaine seizures after Asia."}
