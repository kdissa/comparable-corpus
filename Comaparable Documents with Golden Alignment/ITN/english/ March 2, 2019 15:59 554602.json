Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthamanâ€™s MiG-21 jet was shot down by a Pakistani fighter during a clash over Kashmir on Wednesday as two weeks of growing tensions between the two countries erupted into open hostilities. The plane crashed on the Pakistani side of the de facto border that separates the two sides of Kashmir, a Himalayan region that has been a source of hostility between the two countries since independence from Britain in 1947. Tensions escalated rapidly following a suicide car bombing on February 14 that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir."}
