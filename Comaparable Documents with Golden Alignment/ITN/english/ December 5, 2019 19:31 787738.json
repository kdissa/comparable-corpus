Accordingly the tax will be increased from one rupee and sixty cents to six rupees and fifteen cents depending on the length of the cigarettes. It will be effective from the first of this month. Treasury has issued a notice in this regard under the Excise regulations. The Government has increased the cigarette tax in proportion to the reduction of the Value Added Tax and the Nation Building Tax. However, the Ceylon Tobacco Company said that there would be no price increase in the cigarettes. The Government recently took a decision to reduce VAT from 15 percent to eight percent and also withdraw the Nation Building Tax for local goods."}
