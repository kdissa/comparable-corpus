Cabello, who already led the pack at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, urged her fans in the United States to vote in the 2018 midterm elections as she walked the red carpet in the northern Spanish city of Bilbao. The singer, who rose to fame as a member of the girl group “Fifth Harmony,” formed on the U.S. edition of the X-Factor, said she relished being seen as a role model. The show took place at Bilbao’s exhibition centre and was hosted by Hailee Steinfeld, who performed “Back to Life,” a song that will feature on the soundtrack of her forthcoming movie Bumblebee."}
