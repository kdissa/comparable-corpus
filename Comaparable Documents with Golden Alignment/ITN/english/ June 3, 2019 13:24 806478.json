The government has never released a death toll of the June 4, 1989 crackdown, but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundreds to several thousands. China slid into economic chaos in 1988 with panic buying triggered by rising inflation peaking at more than 30 percent in cities. Public discontent, coupled with the death of purged reform-minded Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989, set the stage for the demonstrations. More than one million people flooded into central Beijing, keen to vent their anger against corruption, economic mismanagement, nepotism and poor career prospects for students."}
