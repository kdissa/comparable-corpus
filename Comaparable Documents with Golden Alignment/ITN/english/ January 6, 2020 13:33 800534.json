A resolution passed by a special session of parliament said the government should cancel its request for assistance from a U.S.-led coalition. Parliament resolutions, unlike laws, are non-binding to the government. But this one is likely to be heeded. Meanwhile, President Trump has threatened severe sanctions against Iraq after its parliament called on US troops to leave the country. UPSOUND"}
