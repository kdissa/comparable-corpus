Holder Isner struggled to continue late in the second set, hampered by pain in his left foot. Federer, who won his fourth Miami title, broke Isner three times in a blazing opening set. But the American fought back in the second, leveling the set 3-3 and 4-4 before the pain made it difficult to continue. Federer took the final two games for the victory. Only American Jimmy Connors, with 109, has more career singles titles. Even before the injury slowed Isner, Federer was the master, tempering Isnerâ€™s big serves and winning 32 of 35 points on his own serve."}
