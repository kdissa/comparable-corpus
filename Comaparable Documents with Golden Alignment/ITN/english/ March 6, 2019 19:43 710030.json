He thanked the Police, Narcotics Bureau, Special Task Force, Coast Guards, Customs and Excise Departments for producing good results in anti-drug raids and detections.Answering a question, President Sirisena said that he had not changed his mind about carrying out capital punishment against repeated drug smugglers who continue to indulge in drugs smuggling and distribution while in prison. He said that those who are against capital punishment should understand the catastrophe caused to the young generation by these criminals.The President said the police and other agencies have done a good job even without sophisticated technical equipment for drugs detection and promised that the best available technical equipment will be purchased shortly. He said early steps would be taken to recruit more policemen, especially Tamil speaking policemen to be posted to Tamil speaking areas. Immediately, 2,500 police personnel will be recruited."}
