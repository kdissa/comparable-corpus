Chasing a target of 162, New Zealand lost three wickets in the powerplay overs. They were one batsman short as Martin Guptill could not come out to bat because of stomach cramps. The fourth-wicket partnership between Colin de Grandhomme and Tom Bruce kept the BlackCaps in the hut. Grandhomme scored a 46-ball 59 and Bruce scored a 46-ball 53. The Kiwis lost quick wickets in death overs but Mitchell Santner finished the game with two hits in the final over."}
