The 31-year-old Scot blasted a backhand cross-court return winner on match point to end the two-and-a-half hour contest and dispatch the fourth seed. Alexander Zverev won 82 percent of his first serves in his rain-interrupted match that started on Tuesday against Malek Jaziri en route to a 6-2 6-1 win over the Tunisian. Top seed Zverev will face off Thursday (August 2) with his 15th seeded brother Mischa Zverev who got past American Tim Smyczek 6-2 7-6(7). Earlier on Wednesday, Nick Kyrgios withdrew from the tournament with a hip injury, another setback in the Australianâ€™s buildup to the U.S. Open."}
