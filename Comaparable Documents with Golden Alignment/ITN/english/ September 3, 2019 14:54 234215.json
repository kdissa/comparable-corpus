The fresh arrival is a 15-week-old Jack Russell puppy, who has been adopted by Johnson and delivered to the British leader’s official residence. The dog, who doesn’t yet have a name, came from an animal rescue charity in south Wales. It’s hoped the adoption will help publicise Lucy’s Law a crackdown on puppy farms, which mistreat young dogs. Downing Street already has a resident cat, Larry, who carries the official title of “Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office”. It’s not clear how the two animals will get along, but Larry may not be too worried."}
