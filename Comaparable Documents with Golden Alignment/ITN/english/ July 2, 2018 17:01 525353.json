Hot weather and wind over the last week have sparked fires in parts of the northern English countryside unprecedented in recent times in an area better known for its rainy weather. Greater Manchester Police said in a statement that a major incident was declared after the fires on Winter Hill and Scout Road near Bolton merged, referring to an area roughly 12 miles northwest of the city. Meanwhile, a rain-triggered landslide cut off a local road in Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County, southwest Chinaâ€™s Sichuan Province. No casualties or damages to passing vehicles were caused, thanks to timely monitoring and early warning from local authorities. The accident started with sporadic rock-falls. Local transport and public security authorities immediately put up a cordon at the scene and suspended traffic, not long before a huge landslide completely cut off the road."}
