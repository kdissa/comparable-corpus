The planned protest route for Wednesday does not pass down the Champs Elysees, keeping instead to the south of the capital, but the “yellow vests” have said they will attend.Interior Minister Christophe Castaner was expected to detail plans to secure the protest route in a news conference at 1430GMT on Tuesday."}
