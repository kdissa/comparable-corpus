Downpour hit Tongjiang County of southwest China’s Sichuan Province from around 14:00 and lasted to 20:00 on Wednesday, flooding many streets and paralyzing traffic. Water-logging was around one meter in the deepest place, and even spilled into roadside houses. Traffic police and related authorities rushed to the flooded streets and ran against time to drain the water. Traffic resumed at around 19:00 after the flood receded. Heavy rains that started to fall on Monday in northwest China’s Shaanxi Province affected more than 7,700 people in Nanzheng District of Hanzhong City and Shiquan and Ziyang counties in Ankang City. Over 3,000 people have been evacuated so far. The rains and flood affected 510 hectares of crops and destroyed 263.8 hectares’ croplands, and caused cave-in in some highway sections."}
