He made this reference at a media briefing held today. The Road Development Authority Chairman said that work on 10 kilomteres from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya is being speedily carried out and they expected to open this stretch for traffic on the 15 of October. Its significance is that the Expressway directed to the South links the Katunayake Expressway. As such this will reduce to a considerable extent vehicles entering Colombo Because anyone wishing to travel to Panadura and Horana can reach their destinations without entering Colombo. Taking past lessons into consideration, the road has been raised where floods take place so that the people are not being inconvenienced. As such Nihal Suriyarachchi said that the public could use this road without any fear."}
