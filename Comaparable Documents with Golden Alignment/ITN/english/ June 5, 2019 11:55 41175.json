The revised death toll came after two days of unrest which began when forces of the Transitional Military Council fired on unarmed protesters. Members of a feared paramilitary group have reportedly been roaming the streets attacking civilians since. The military has faced international condemnation for the deadly crackdown. However, an attempt by the UK and Germany at the UN to call on the Sudanese military to work towards finding a solution was blocked by China, who were backed by Russia."}
