Two years ago walking would have been unimaginable for the 47-year-old, who was paralysed from the waist down after a bicycle accident five years ago. But thanks to a spinal implant developed by Swiss-based scientists, he’s able to take tentative steps towards rehabilitation and increased independence. Last year Tobler underwent an experimental procedure where a spinal cord stimulator was implanted in his body. It acts as a bridge between the brain and the paralysed limbs, restoring some cerebral communication across the damaged site. Sixteen electrodes are connected from the implant to the nerve endings in Tobler’s lumbar spinal cord. Each electrode delivers targeted electrical stimulation depending on the movement he wants to make.During a training session witnessed by Reuters at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Tobler worked with a physical therapist as he used crutches to walk up and down a treatment room.
