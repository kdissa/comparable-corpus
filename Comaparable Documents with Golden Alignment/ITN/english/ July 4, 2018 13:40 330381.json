Disengagement and Observer Force. Israel beefed up its tank and artillery deployment on the Golan Heights frontier with Syria, cautioning Damascus’ forces to keep a distance as they sweep rebel-held areas over the border.Israel seized much of the Golan from Syria in the 1967 war and annexed the strategic plateau, a move not recognised abroad.Israel is also concerned that Iran is establishing a military presence in Syria, and it has attacked Iranian targets there.Putin and Netanyahu held a phone conversation last month and agreed to strengthen coordination on Syria and discussed joint efforts to ensure security in the area of the Syrian-Israeli border, the Kremlin said.Netanyahu will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow next week, Netanyahu’s office said in a brief statement on Tuesday. The meeting is set for Wednesday, July 11. Netanyahu and Putin meet periodically and discuss regional issues, particularly concerning mutual interests in the civil war in Syria and to avoid accidental clashes between Israeli and Russian forces that both operate in Syria. The two leaders last met in Moscow in May."}
