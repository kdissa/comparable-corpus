The study, published in the journal Nature , is the latest to show that artificial intelligence has the potential to improve the accuracy of screening for breast cancer, which affects one in eight women globally. The findings of the study, developed with Alphabetâ€™s DeepMind AI unit which merged with Google Health in September, represent a major advance in the potential for the early detection of breast cancer,"}
