Guaido, head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, last month invoked constitutional provisions to assume an interim presidency, arguing that President Nicolas Maduro’s re-election last year was fraudulent. He has since been recognised by most Western nations as the rightful leader of Venezuela. But he faces possible arrest if he returns to Venezuela for disobeying a Supreme Court order that he should not leave the country pending an investigation."}
