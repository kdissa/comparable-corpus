Set 339 after a maiden century from Sri Lanka’s Avishka Fernando, the Windies were 84-4 in the 18th over. Pooran played some swashbuckling shots, ably supported by Fabian Allen (51). Yet with 31 needed from the last three overs, Pooran was caught behind as West Indies closed on 315-9, Lasith Malinga claiming 3-55. Both teams began the match knowing they could not qualify for the semi-finals but produced a classic encounter. Sri Lanka’s pace spearhead Malinga, who earlier had two catches dropped off his bowling in one over, then saw Pooran offer a straightforward chance to long-off on 108, but substitute fielder Thisara Perera misjudged it horrendously and it went for four."}
