At least 26 people have died and thousands were displaced after flash floods and landslides hit Jakarta on New Year’s Day. This year’s flooding was the worst after the city government halted a river bank normalisation project in the area sitting next to the Ciliwung River, which runs more than 100 km from its source in West Java to Jakarta bay and had become a dumping ground for local community."}
