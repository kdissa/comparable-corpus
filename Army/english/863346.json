The Army Directorate of Rehabilitation, headed by Major General S.K Thirunavukarasu, Director Rehabilitation was behind organizing this second batch too for the tour, considering their spiritual needs, interests and attachment to the Buddhist places of worship in India. The Army bears the cost of airfare and facilities to those differently-able War Heroes, some of them are wheelchair-ridden for the rest of their lives.
