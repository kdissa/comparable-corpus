Major General Kumudu Perera, Commander, Security Forces - Wanni at the invitation of the Imam (leader) who earlier reached the Wanni Commander and expressed his intention of organizing an appreciative prayer session of this nature, attended the congregational prayers as the Chief Guest, together with a group of Officers and Other Rankers. This was the first ever such instance reported in the recent past history where Muslims took an own initiative of this nature in the whole of the Wanni region. The special prayer, composed of a sermon, delivered by the Imam, Rev Al Hafeel Amir was attended by leading Muslim devotees in the Vavuniya town. A group of Muslims in the Army and all ranks serving the Wanni region also joined the congregation. 211 Brigade Headquarters extended its support for coordination of the religious event with mosque authorities on the instructions of the Security Force Headquarters â€“ Wanni (SFHQ-W). During the congregation, blessings were invoked symbolically on all Army flags of formations under the Security Force Headquarters - Wanni after the Imam delivered a brief sermon on the occasion. At the end of the prayer session, Major General Perera presented a memento and a cash gift to the Imam on behalf of all serving the Wanni region."}
