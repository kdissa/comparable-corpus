They profusely thanked each and everyone for all the courage and support given to protect the country at the risk of their precious lives. Memories were afterwards made eternal after Chief Guests posing for separate group photographs with all those who were present at the farewell parade. Reminding all of them the unwavering importance of the much-revered SLLI motto, ‘I Serve’ (Ich Dien), the outgoing Senior Officers joined refreshments with everyone. At the end of the events, the outgoing Senior Officers were presented a street-line farewell bidding ‘Jaya Sri’ by Officers and Other Ranks of the SLLI, as they began to leave the Regimental Headquarters premises, which remained as their second homes for decades. Separate farewell dinners at SLLI Officers’ Mess appreciated their contribution to the growth of the SLLI awarding them with special mementos amidst hundreds of fellow-officers and distinguished guests."}
