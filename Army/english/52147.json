The day's Chief Guest was also invited to plant a mango sapling to mark his visit to the SLAVF-HQ where the Logistics HQ is also situated. During his stay there, Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva closely watched ongoing preparations for erection of new accommodation buildings for SLAVF personnel, new playground and other units as well as the proposed Sri Lanka Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (SLEME) Industrial Park of the Army.
