They kept Major General Dushyantha Rajaguru, Commander, Security Forces - Mullaittivu (SF-MLT) informed of the detection of the animal which was struggling for life and sought instructions. On his advice, steps were taken immediately to connect with the Mullaittivu Wildlife Office, enabling one of the veterinary officers of the Zonal Office, together with a few assistants to show up at the location, following directions given by the troops. After initial medical treatment, those officials took the injured deer of about 10 - 12 years of age to the veterinary office for further attention and care. Those officials maintained that the deer in question would have been struck by a passing vehicle inflicting injuries to the spinal area of the deer."}
