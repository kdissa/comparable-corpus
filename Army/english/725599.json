Guided by Colonel K. A. N Rasika Kumara, 213 Brigade Commander on the instructions of Major General Kumar Jayapathirana, General Officer Commanding, 21 Division, those troops after placing sandbags around threatened patches averted a major split in both bunds which could have been disastrous unless addressed. Hundreds of families living in those low-level areas adjoining those tank bunds supported the troops and thanked them for their timely action that had helped them enormously."}
