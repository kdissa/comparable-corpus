The programme identified 65 new coconut cultivators, living in 61 Division area who showed up and assured them of free saplings, fertilizer and all other guiding instructions until the seedlings reach harvesting stage. Regional Manager, Coconut Cultivation Board in the Wanni and North, together with other officials actively participated in the introductory project and promised their support to the vilagers. The project in collaboration with the Coconut Cultivation Board is closely supervised by Brigadier K. D. C. G. J Thilakarathne, General Officer Commanding 61 Division. Troops of the 61 Division organized the introductory programme."}
