The band team of the Kahapathvilagama Primary School was practising with locally-made musical instruments, using Bamboo sticks and other natural items when the pathetic plight was observed by the troops. After identifying the inborn skills and talents of those students in this remote school, the 21 Division took an initiative and coordinated with this philanthropist in Gem Industry seeking his assistance for this worthy cause. The sponsor accordingly provided an assortment modern musical instruments for those less fortunate students. The donation of the stock took place  during a brief ceremony, held at Kahapathwilagama Primary School on Monday  (9), graced by the Sponsor and the General Officer Commanding of 21 Division, Major General Kumar Jayapathirane as Chief Guests. Senior Officers, Officers and Other Ranks of Headquarters 21 Division and its under command formations, the Principal of Kahapathvilagama Primary School along with staff members and students too were present at the occasion."}
