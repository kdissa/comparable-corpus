After a drive-past Guard Turn Out greeted him on entering the premises, Brigadier Vajira Kariyawasam, Commandant, Ragama Ranaviru Sevana welcomed the Visiting Commander. The Army Chief showing his fatherly concern for the inmates as a true, battle hardened soldier who too had suffered injuries while fighting for the country went to all 93 inmates lying in separate wards and spoke to each of them on the historic Army Day. Lieutenant General Silva shared a few thoughts with them and inquired into their grievances and needs, if any during their stay since some of them had the distinction of working with the incumbent Commander while he was spearheading operations in the Wanni. During their stay, each War Hero received a gift parcel from the Commander of the Army. Towards the end of the visit, the Commander had a brief meeting with the Ranaviru Sevana administrators and inquired into their requirements during refreshments. Before his departure, as a customary feature, the Commander of the Army left his remarks in the visitors’ book and inked memories on the 70th Army Day."}
