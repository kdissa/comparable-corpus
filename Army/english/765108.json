The event was held under the guidance of the Chief Incumbent Buddhist Centre Welikanda, Ven. Delwita Mettalankara Thero. Colonel General Staff SFHQ-E, Colonel Chaminda Wijayaratne and several Senior Officers participated in the project. This temple was established in 1942 and survived during the conflict with many difficulties. The temple lacked this object of veneration, the Pagoda (Stupa), one of the main features in typical places of Buddhist worship.  With the generosity of Mr. Saddhathissa in Kelaniya area, the construction of this ‘Stupa’ is to be completed within a few months. A gathering of Buddhist devotees took part in the ceremony."}
