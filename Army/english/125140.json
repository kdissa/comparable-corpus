The stock of school accessories to the value of Rs 50,000 was thus distributed in the presence of the donor representatives and the Commander 233 Brigade Colonel Anil Samarasiri who attended as the chief guest. This community-oriented welfare programme was an initiative taken by the SFHQ-East and the 233 Brigade of the 23 Division to support promotion of education among needy children in the area as poverty has placed a major setback for continuation of their schooling. Many of those girls in the Home are orphans or with single parent but are used to attend nearby schools for education despite financial difficulties for purchase of school accessories or books. Meanwhile, the same 233 Brigade Headquarters at the request of authorities contributed to the construction of a  Toddlersâ€™ park near the church premises in Mankerni under the guidance of Colonel Anil Samarasiri, 233 Brigade Commander with the approval given by the 23 Division and the Security Force Headquarters  - East (SFHQ-E). This was an initiative aimed at supporting education of children by providing facilities to enhance their sport skills and personality development. The park was ceremonially opened and handed over to the church authorities by the Commander 233 Brigade on Saturday (05).  A large gathering of children and parents attended this occasion."}
