The whole forenoon prayers, conducted in full swing on Saturday (9), mirroring the Army's continued dedication to the promotion of reconciliation, religious and ethnic harmony reverberated around the precincts for hours and ensured those Catholic priests, Moulavi and Kurkkal (Muslim and Hindu clergies and priests) invoke blessings on the new premises in an elaborate manner through comprehensive religious prayers and performances.

Chairmen and office-bearers in all Army religious organizations took the leadership in organizing those multi-religious segments."}
