A few excerpts of full message are as follows; “The best tribute we can pay to the memory of fallen War Heroes is to ensure that no more space be made available for recurrence of any sort of violence or war while serving as a disciplined and professional soldier and protecting the territorial integrity and day-to-day life of the people irrespective of any differences. You all have to be sensitive to what is happening at present and other global developments. I wish no more recurrence of any warfare would happen in Sri Lanka as all Sri Lankans have a strong faith in the Army as Defenders of the Nation. At the same time, the light of development has dawned in many war affected areas by now and the displaced people are reaping the benefits of peace and reconciliation as they now have the full trust in all Army personnel as the ‘Rata Rakina Jathiya’.” “For the unitary status of the country, a total of 20,474 brave War Heroes laid their lives and 3,488 Army War Heroes were reported missing. Likewise, over 37,000 Army War Heroes became disabled for the rest of their lives. In addition, members of the civil staff also laid their lives for the sake of the country. I salute all of them at this 10th milestone anniversary and pray all of them attain supreme bliss of Nirvana and wish speedy recovery to all the injured.”"}
