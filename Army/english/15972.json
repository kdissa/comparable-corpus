This particular tank remains the main source of water for agricultural needs of the farmers living in Vadukkoddai area but it had to be re-dug and renovated in order to have more water retained during dry weather seasons. The process for complete renovation was initiated by Dr. Sidambaran Mohan, the President of ‘Friends of Jaffna’ organization and the Farmers’ Society at Vadukkoddai (Southwest). He approached Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi, Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna for assistance and requested the participation of troops and machinery for the purpose. Troops, villagers and farmers joined hands together and completed the renovation within a few weeks before monsoon rains set in enabling the tank to collect more and more rainy water in the future. Consul General for High Commission of India in Jaffna, Mr. S Balachandran and Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi during a simple ceremony on Sunday (2) formally vested the renovated tank with villagers amid Hindu rites and rituals. Civilians, impressed with the Army role presented a special memento to the Jaffna Commander who was invited to sprinkle the auspicious water symbolizing the project. Unveiling a plaque marked the opening of the renovated tank for public use. Religious dignitaries of Hindu and Buddhist faiths, Officials of the District and Divisional Secretariats, Major General Roshan Seneviratne, General Officer Commanding, 51 Division, Army personnel who completed the job, government officials, civilians and farmers took part in the inaugural ceremony, held on the banks of the renovated tank."}
