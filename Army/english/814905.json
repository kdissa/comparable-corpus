Brigadier M. A Azad Izadeen, Director Rehabilitation explained how he himself being a Muslim devotee condemned such brutal slayings of innocent prayers “We as Senior Officers in the Army who fought against LTTE terrorism and defeated it feel ashamed and sad about the loss of more than 250 human lives. Did we fight like that to get discredited in this way as Muslims. You all got to sympathize with those who perished in this tragedy and try to re-build the confidence the people have lost about us if we are to go ahead as a united one nation. We are religiously and culturally different but belong to one Nation,” he told the gathering.
