Constructions were effectively carried out by troops of the 11 Sri Lanka Artillery and 7 Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment in respective areas. Each new house is comprised of all facilities such as the sitting area, dining room, bed rooms, etc and each was gifted with essential household items, electric appliances and furniture worth over Rs. 100,000.00. In addition, these beneficiaries were much fortunate to receive a modern electric tube well that cost more than Rs. 100,000.00. Religious observances preceded the warming ceremonies. The keys of each house were offered to heads of two households during a brief ceremony by the Commander Security Forces - Wanni, Major General Jagath Gunawardena who graced the occasion as the Chief Guest.
