A representative group of ‘Neth’ FM News, led by Mr. Asanga Jayasooriya, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) on Wednesday (9) evening called at the Commander's office and symbolically handed over a consignment of what the project collected from students at Dodangoda Maha Vidyalaya, Akuressa Maha Vidyalaya, Ruwanwella Rajasinghe Central College and Homagama Mahinda Rajapakse Vidyalaya to the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake for distribution among school-goers in flood-affected Kilinochchi and Mullaittivu  areas. The consignment of relief supplies included thousands of exercise books, drawing books, instrument boxes, school bags, water containers, uniform materials, shoes, trouser materials, socks, etc worth a few lakhs. The Commander appreciative of their thoughtful reconciliation gestures commended the broadcasters for their efforts, inculcating notions of co-existence, harmony, understanding and humanitarian concern for fellow-students at a time the help of Southerners was most wanted for them to resume school studies. On the instructions of the Commander, the consignment of those relief stocks is to be sent to most required areas in consultation with respective Security Force Headquarters shortly."}
