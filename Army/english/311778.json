Formalities of the day included a Guard Turnout at the entrance and a separate Guard of Honour parade after the GR Centre Commandant, Brigadier W.H.K.S Peiris, flanked by Senior veterans and Officers warmly received him before he was invited to review the parade in keeping with military traditions in the company of the parade Commander. Attired in ceremonials, Major General Silva, atop the special dais took the salute of his All Ranks in the parade. At the outset, he paid his deep respect to the GR's founding father, late Major General Vijaya Wimalarathna’s monumental bust near the entrance, recalling valour and gallantry of the great GR soldier who left an indelible name in the annals of warfare in the country. As melodies of patriotic songs began reverberating bringing the ceremonials to end, the new Chief of Staff after a little while was invited to address hundreds of GR Officers and Other Ranks who had by then gathered to listen to him.  A few minutes later, he joined refreshments with All Ranks at the Other Ranks’ Mess and posed for group photos at the Parade Square adding memories to the rare occasion. He also planted a sapling in the premises and symbolized his first visit to the place after his new appointment. GR Headquarters after a few minutes invited the new Chief of Staff to the Officers’ Mess for a luncheon treat with representative Senior Officers as one more customary segment of the day's ceremonial formalities. Senior GR Veterans, GR Council Members, GR Headquarters Centre Commandant, Deputy Centre Commandant, Senior officers and a crowd of Other Rankers were associated with those formalities and the reception."}
