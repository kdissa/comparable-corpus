Germany-based ‘Church in Need’ in collaboration with the Parish Priest, Rev T.E Devarajan has sponsored the cost, but the church requested the Army Engineers to do the construction. Accordingly, Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi, Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna (SF-J) undertook the responsibility and instructed his troops to complete the project at the earliest. Brigadier Ajith Elwatta, representing the Commander, SF-J at the request of the church cut a ribbon and warmed the new Parish House on Sunday (14).  During the same ceremony, several symbolic appreciative mementos were awarded to Heads of constructing teams of the Army by members of the church. A gathering of church members, civilians and Army troops attended the opening ceremony."}
