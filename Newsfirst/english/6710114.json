As such, Australia has announced its increased support for humanitarian demining efforts in Sri Lanka. Australia will provide AUD 1mn (over Rs.124mn) in assistance over the next two years through a partnership with the Mine Action Group (MAG) and Sri Lankan organization Devlon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH). This increased funding will provide vital additional mine clearance capacity in Mannar and Vavuniya, two critical mine-affected provinces. It will allow many families to return to their land, re-establish their lives and enhance income-earning opportunities. Australia has been one of the largest contributors to demining in Sri Lanka, contributing AUD 20mn since 2009."}
