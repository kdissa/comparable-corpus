Reuters has cited government and diplomatic officials as the source of information. The news agency also reports that the IMF has declined to comment on the matter. The loan program was delayed in November 2018 by the IMF due to the political uncertainty in the country at the time. The IMF has already disbursed over $1bn of the agreed $1.5bn loan."}
