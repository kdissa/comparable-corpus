But looming large over his future is a man on the other side of Manhattan who also starts his new job soon. When asked if Trump’s criticism on the failure to perform and for Security Council vote against Israel on settlements’ worried him, Guterres responded, “No. I am concerned about all the terrible problems’ we face in the world, all the wars’ that are happening everywhere.” He added, “I hope we will all be able to come together.” Trump did say the UN has “such great potential”, therefore he claimed that it is true that the UN has such great potential and that his job is to make sure that potential becomes a reality. The United States is by far the largest funder of the 193 member countries of the UN, providing more than 20% of the UN budget. Any secretary-general has to make sure relations are good with the White House. This is only the second time a UN Secretary-General and a US President will begin their terms within weeks of each other. Source – CNN"}
