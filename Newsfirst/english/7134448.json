They have brought Heroin to feed the people. Then there is the ethanol and the casinos. Why can’t the government say that this was the Minister that brought the ethanol? Why can’t the government reveal who the importer was? Who brought it? Who was the clearing agent? Inform the press if you are not at fault. Who brought the Heroin?” He further stated, “They are just using the Prime Minister’s Secretary as a scapegoat. Everyone has said that there are drug smugglers in parliament and in the cabinet. Who are they? Reveal this information. The Prime Minister is a person who for so many years has been in politics and has acted very cordially with all communities.”"}
