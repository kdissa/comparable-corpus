He further stated that he saw a former leader carrying out ‘politics from a temple’.  He said that since that day no UNPer enters the premises of that temple and no alms are given to the temple. He said: But now look at the what the UNP  is doing as well. For instance imagine if Ranil Wickremesinghe also goes to a different temple in the same area and makes donations. See what a naive and unfair thing that would be to do. He further added that the country’s politics should be run not from inside a temple, church or school. I am disappointed that through such activities issues of racism arise, he pointed out. Chief Minister Harin Fernando made this statement at an event organised to lay the foundation stone of a three-storey building in the Al Adan Muslim School in Badulla. The Chief Minister also took part in an awards ceremony."}
