Aside from which, the global financial system is moving away from a single currency dominated International system, towards a multi-currency international system. New sources of investment capital are reducing Western dominance. New consumer markets, and the expansion of the Asian middle class, are changing the traditional focus of markets. The wealth and technology gap between the West and the East has narrowed significantly by the sheer weight of numbers in Asia. So it is possible to argue, that the Indian Ocean region, has an extraordinary opportunity to create something new in the global context and something historically uniquely beneficial for its people.”, said Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe. Premier Wickremesinghe also noted that it is time for Indian Ocean countries to take the lead in determining their own future. He also stated that an Indian Ocean order needs to be crafted “with accepted rules and agreements that would guide interaction between states” on a consensual agreement. He also pointed out that no singular state should dominate the system. Chairman of the Sri Lanka Mahabodhi Society Ven. Banagala Upatissa Thero, attended the event as a special invitee."}
