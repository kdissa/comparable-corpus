The Opposition Leader made this statement in a communique issued in response to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statement that Parliament would be dissolved after April 23. In his statement, the Opposition Leader points out that only President Maithripala Sirisena, who is also the President of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has been vested with the power under the constitution, to call for a parliamentary election. Nimal Siripala de Silva recalls that the SLFP and its parliamentary group have agreed to co-operate with the 100-day programme, in opposition. The Opposition Leader points out that in the midst of such co-operation being extended,  SLFP supporters continue to face intimidation and pressure, and added that he has called for a debate in parliament regarding the matter on the 10th of this month, where he will call on the government to provide compensation for damage to property, and other damages."}
