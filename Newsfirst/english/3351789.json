He expressed these views in an exclusive interview with News 1st. He said that instead of good governance, what they are doing is suppressing their opponents and that this is immensely harmful to President Maithripala Sirisena’s concept of good governance. He further noted that two ministers threatened him when he was in the government. He also stated that some UNP Ministers are trying to take away the privileges given by the President. Views were also expressed by government representatives on the resignation of MP Tissa Karaliyadda. Minister of Social Services and Welfare, P. Harrison said that even without the minister the government is moving forward without any problem and that it doesn’t mean that the others are going to make the same decision. Deputy Minister of Mass Media, Shantha Bandara stated that these ministerial Portfolios have not been discussed before appointment. Some people might raise questions that the deputy ministerial portfolios given to certain people might be inadequate given that they have served in the cabinet for years."}
