Bomb equipment, weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition were found by police in a raid after Wednesday’s shootout that killed the two suspects. Authorities still have not found a motive in the attack by Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27. The names of the victims have now been released by San Bernardino’s coroner. The youngest victim was 26 and the oldest was 60. Police said the attack indicated there had been “some degree of planning”. Local police chief Jarrod Burguan said it appeared that the duo was prepared to carry out another attack. In the shootout with police hours after the attack, Farook and Malik fired 76 rounds of ammunition at the officers and the officers fired 380 rounds back. Two police officers were injured during the pursuit. It marks the deadliest mass shooting in the US since 26 people were killed at a school in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012."}
