Glenda Jackson and Denzel Washington were nominated for acting Tonys, while “Mean Girls” and “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical” scored the most nominations with 12 each, including for best musical. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” a new play about the grown wizard and his troubled relationship with his teen-aged son, won 10 nominations, including best play and best actor for star Jamie Parker. The more than five-hour, two-part saga earned raves on Broadway after winning record Olivier awards in London last year (2017). Another monumental two-part drama, a revival of “Angels in America,” took 11 nominations, including best play revival, best actor Andrew Garfield and best-featured actor for Nathan Lane as closeted conservative firebrand Roy Cohn."}
