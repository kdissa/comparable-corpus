Warner Bros has officially announced on Monday that Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne will star in Harry Potter spin-off film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. He will play pre-eminent Wizarding World magizoologist, Newt Scamander, who writes the famous Hogwarts School textbook that gives the film its title. The script will be written by “Potter” author J.K. Rowling herself, and longtime “Potter” director David Yates will return. The film’s director David Yates said: “Eddie is a fearless actor, brimming with invention, wit and humanity.” He added: “I couldn’t be more excited about the prospect of working with him as we start this new adventure in JK Rowling’s wonderful world, and I know she feels the same way.” Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts book, which was published in 2001, is set 70 years before the events of her bestselling Potter series. It follows the adventures of magizoologist Scamander – a specialist in magical animals – who travels the Wizarding World to document the beasts he encounters. He writes a book – Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them – which is then studied years later by Hogwarts students such as Harry, Ron and Hermoine. Director Yates previously directed the final four Potter films, while producer David Heyman – who worked on all eight of the blockbusters – will produce the film. Earlier this year he won the best actor Oscar, a Bafta, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award for his performance as Stephen Hawking in biopic The Theory of Everything. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is scheduled to be released in theaters on November 18, 2016."}
