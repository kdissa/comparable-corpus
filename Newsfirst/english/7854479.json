However, after being elected do these Public Representatives commit themselves towards fulfilling the aspirations of the people? An unusual situation was reported from the Hingurakgoda Pradeshiya Sabha today (May 02). During the inaugural session of the Hingurakgoda Pradeshiya Sabha, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Members wore black bands. One member entered the premises wearing a mask. These members protested claiming the appointment of the SLFP’s D.R.Udawatte as the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha was illegal. As this led to an uneasy situation in the Pradeshiya Sabha, the Chairman decided to postpone the session for half an hour. Later the session was postponed to the 24th of May.
