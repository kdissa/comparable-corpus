Thereafter,  civilians are to be brought to Sri Lanka aboard an aircraft that belongs to Sri Lanka. Around 91 Sri Lankans are reportedly caught in the middle of the conflict in Yemen According to Chairman of the Foreign Employment Bureau Rathnapala Wickremasuriya, the delay in bringing the locals back to the country has been caused due to Chinese air crafts not being granted permission to fly in Yemen air space. It was reported to News1st that three Sri Lankans who were trapped in Yemen due to the conflict have already arrived in the country. When an inquiry was made from Deputy General Manger of the Foreign Employment Bureau Mangala Randeniya in this regard, he had stated that an official statement cannot be made regarding their arrival as it had been arranged privately."}
