He further stated that he had spoken of the matter on a number of occasions in parliament and explained that they are not prepared to enter into such agreements with the US government. The State Minister of Defence continued to say that it is not just with the US but that they will not allow any other country to establish bases in the country as well and further assured that the government will not enter into agreements that will have a negative impact on national security. He said that if an agreement is to be signed that it should be done by the President himself in his capacity as the Minister of Defence or by the Defence Secretary upon the authorization of the President. The State Minister reiterated that however there is no such need to sign such a disadvantageous agreement."}
