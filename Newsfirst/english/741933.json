He was due to lead an opposition march on Sunday but his supporters will now be marching to mourn his death. President Vladimir Putin condemned Mr Nemtsov’s murder as “vile and cynical” and vowed to find the killers. Mr Nemtsov’s allies call it a political killing linked to his opposition to Mr Putin and the Ukraine conflict. Opposition supporters are due to gather in central Moscow  on Sunday before marching to the spot on Great Moskvoretsky Bridge where Mr Nemtsov was killed. Moscow city authorities had previously approved a march for up to 50,000 people but organisers said more people might now attend following the murder. Source: BBC"}
