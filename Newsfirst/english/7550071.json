Kim ordered the group of women that was hand-picked by authorities loyal to his father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, to be disbanded shortly after his death in December 2011, according to South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper. He has now decided, however, to resurrect a source of entertainment that has become a tradition for North Korean leaders. “After he came to power, Kim trusted no-one and ordered thorough investigations into every official in the regime, from the highest to the lowest”, Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo’s Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told. With that process now completed, as well as the conclusion of the three-year official mourning period after the death of Kim Jong-il, the new North Korean dictator is free to select a new generation of female companions. The women who were employed as entertainers were given pay-offs of $4,000 – a huge sum in impoverished North Korea – and home appliances. Women who were employed as maids and cleaners at Kim Jong-il’s palaces received about half that amount. Source: The Telegraph"}
