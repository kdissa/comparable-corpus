According to media reports, SLFP Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan has been nominated for the position of Deputy Speaker. However, reports say the Tamil National Alliance is opposed to this appointment. Reports have emerged that the UNP would nominate Monaragala district MP Ananda Kumarasiri for this position while the SLFP’s group of 16 is expected to nominate Sudarshani Fernandopulle for the position of Deputy Speaker. Other names that have been proposed include Cader Mastan, Malith Jayathilake and Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena of the SLFP. The position of Deputy Speaker became vacant when SLFP MP Thilanga Sumathipala voted against the Prime Minister during the no-confidence motion and resigned from the government as well as the position of Deputy Speaker. Sumathipala’s resignation from the position of Deputy Speaker is to be officially announced to Parliament tomorrow (June 05). UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara stated that there is no decision yet on the Deputy Speaker and that they do not know whom they will support. He added that he is of the position that they must clearly support a candidate who is opposed to the UNP. According to MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena of the UPFA, if an MP who is a political henchman is put forward then they will certainly vote against him or her. He stated that they will fulfill their responsibility."}
