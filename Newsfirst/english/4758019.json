Chairperson of the Government Midwifery Services Association Devika Kodituwakku said that there is a scarcity of around 2000 midwives countrywide. She warns that this number could reduce further in the coming years. Devika Kodituwakku adds that the number of midwives who are to retire form their services in the years 2016 and 2017 stand at approximately 1700. She stresses that with the scarcity and the amount of midwives retiring there will be an extreme dearth of midwives in the year 2018. The Chairperson of the Government Midwifery Services Association warns that under these circumstances it will be difficult to look into the health of the mothers and the newborns in the future. When News1st contacted the Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Health Dr. Sunil de Alwis, he said that the ministry has taken measures to address the prevalent crisis. Dr. de Alwis adds that the delay in providing solutions to the issue is mainly due to the fact that the Ministry has not received sufficient applications to fill the dearth. The Deputy Director General went on to note that midwives will be enrolled immediately after amendments are made to the enrolling process."}
