Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ajith P. Perera stated that criminals turn black money into white money, which is called money laundering, as they invest money on businesses that appear to legitimate. He added that Yoshitha Rajapaksa’s case is not the first time the law has been enforced and the Carlton Sports Network (CSN) had been accused previously for money laundering and misuse of state assets. Explaining further, he noted that the first complaint filed on  March 15, 2015 by the Citizens for Social Justice Organisation had revealed a sum of 2.3 million US dollars which was included as capital at the CSN company. He alleged that this money was made through false transactions and illegal acts in a foreign state."}
