According toVentureBeat, the software company is currently developing a cross-platform service that will offer “hassle-free” Wi-Fi around the world. The new service, called Microsoft WiFi, was first seen online by Twitter user WalkingCat who also first noticed the OneClip app and the site has since been replaced with a “coming soon” graphic. However, in a statement sent to VentureBeat, a Microsoft representative confirms that the new venture is forthcoming. “We can confirm that we are working on a new service, called Microsoft WiFi, that will bring hassle-free Wi-Fi to millions,” a representative said. “We look forward to sharing additional detail when available.” The effort will work via apps on iOS, Android, OS X, and Windows, and Wi-Fi will be available through a variety of hotspot providers on the fly. However, it won’t come for free at launch; users will reportedly need to be paying Skype Wi-Fi subscribers, work at organizations using Microsoft Office 365 for Enterprise, or use a special Wi-Fi offer from Microsoft. An official announcement is likely on the way, but it’s unclear when Microsoft will roll-out this helpful new feature. -The Verge"}
