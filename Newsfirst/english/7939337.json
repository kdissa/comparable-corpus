Chandrasena convening a media briefing at the Anuradhapura United People’s Freedom Alliance party office today (Feb 2) stated that even if all Alliances will unite, the UNP cannot exceed 103 MPs in Parliament. He added that the 14 members of the Tamil Alliance will never support to run a Government in this country if what they want will not happen. MP Chandrasena pointed out that today Sumanthiran is powerful than Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe because Sumanthiran’s decisions matter to decide whether the Government will run, His decisions are responsible for the ministerial portfolios. He went onto note that there is no issue when the dog is wagging its tail but there is a problem when the tail is wagging the dog, therefore the TNA has become powerful as they run the Government."}
