According to the Central Bank, the diameter and thickness of the new coins have been changed to maintain a progressive pattern with the denomination and different edges being incorporated for easy identification by visually impaired people. The new coins are made of stainless steel, which gives more durability than the existing plated coins. The Cost of production has also been minimized through the reduction of size and weight of the coins and usage of stainless steel. The new coins can be obtained from any commercial bank branch and can be used for payments among other currency notes and coins in circulation."}
