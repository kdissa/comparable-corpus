He added that no matter how unstable the situation becomes they will never agree with any agreement that would harm and destroy the country. He went onto note that if someone agrees to do so, they are going against the pledge they undertook. Minister Premadasa added that the supreme law of the country is that no one is above the constitution and protecting the constitution is everyone’s duty. He said if someone harms the constitution they identify them as unpatriotic and if someone violates the constitution they are unsuitable to even be a citizen of this country.

He stressed that they will never be approved by the cabinet."}
