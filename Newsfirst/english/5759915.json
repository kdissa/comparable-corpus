The minister noted that their attempt is to prevent a split in the party and there are around 10 MPs of the central committee who took part in the march as well namely, Kumara Welgama, Dullas Alahapperuma, Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Mahinda Yapa. ‘For the first time this party has become a party with democracy. It is not a party where just one person takes a decision. The president does not take decisions alone. Decisions are now taken after proposals are presented to the central committee and following hours of discussions. This is for the sake of the party’s betterment”, noted Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. The UPFA General Secretary also revealed that the Joint Opposition made attempts to form a government with the United National Party."}
