What will be the stand of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party? Speaking of the voting UPFA MP Dilan Perera noted that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will take a decision this evening. He preferred if the decision is to vote against the budget. He noted that if the Sri Lanka Freedom Party decided to vote against the budget proposal it would strengthen the ongoing discussions. MP S.B. Dissanayake noted that they are trying their best to stay united within their party and to move forward. However, he noted that there are instances where it is impossible. He added that if the budget proposal can be defeated the Sri Lanka Freedom Party doesn’t have to think twice, but the reality of the situation is that this proposal cannot be defeated because of the TNA and the JVP. The parliamentarian noted that if the JVP decided to defeat the budget then the whole thing turns around and they will do everything in their power to persuade the SLFP to vote against this budget proposal. Meanwhile, Minister P. Harrison noted that they will win the budget at the final voting round tomorrow. When questioned if the TNA have been given any benefits for their vote, he noted that the TNA knows that they have to support the government to develop the country and develop their areas. He added that the TNA was facing hardships because of the war for 30 years at least now they have to make use of this government. When questioned about SLFP’s support, he noted that he believed they will support the budget as the President is also holding a few ministries in this government. He noted that therefore it is their responsibility to support the budget."}
