Modi has since 2014 sought to end what he has called “financial untouchability” by giving millions of people access to banking services in India, which the World Bank estimates has 190 million people without a bank account, second only to China. The India Post Payments Bank will start operations with 650 branches. Accounts will be able to hold a maximum of 100,000 rupees ($1,408) in deposits and will offer limited services. The government said it planned to link its 155,000 post offices to the new payments bank network by Dec. 31 to offer basic bank account services, money transfers and bill payments. “Using this initiative, we will take the bank to villages and to the poor,” Modi said at the launch event in New Delhi, which was also attended by dozens of postal service employees who sat dressed in their khaki-coloured uniforms. More than 300,000 postmen will use smartphones and other digital devices to offer doorstep banking services in remote areas of the country. While Modi addressed a gathering in Delhi, his ministers promoted the launch across the country. The campaign to bring the masses into the financial system could help bolster economic growth and improve Modi’s popularity among the poor ahead of next year’s national election."}
