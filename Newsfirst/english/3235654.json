Addressing a media briefing MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara explained that this move does not mean that the Joint Opposition is in favour of the Executive Presidency, he noted that a decision to oppose the amendment was reached as many members believed that there was an ulterior motive behind the JVP’s decision to bring in the amendment. Vasudeva noted that they would revisit this idea once they have established power with Mahinda Rajapaksa as their Prime Minister However, the Local Government Representatives supporting the JO had something different to say. Udeni Athukorala, Chairman of the All Island Local Government Members Association noted that the sole aim of the 19th amendment was to limit the term limits of a President. He called on members of the Parliament to adopt the 20th amendment and pave the way for Mahinda Rajapaksa to return to power. Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka during an event on Thursday (May 31st) weighed in on the matter and reminded that Mahinda Rajapaksa, two weeks ago, said that abolishing the executive Presidency was the right thing to do. Fonseka remarked that the former president seems to change his word frequently."}
