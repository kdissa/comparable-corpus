The former president went on to add that there were only four leaders in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and those leaders, including President Maithripala Sirisena, lead the country by example. She added that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is the only political party that did not use fear in this country except for a period in the recent past and that is the legacy of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. She added that for a decade that legacy went awry. The former president said that a struggle was launched to get that legacy back on to the correct path and that if the law is implemented properly, persons who are asking for the position of Prime Minister needs to be put in prison. She said however that it if they are allowed to reach leadership level, it will be similar to destroying the aspirations of the people. Bandaranaike Kumaratunga added that even if a king commits a wrong deed, he needs to be sent home and he needs to go home and be silent, and not become blood sucking leeches in politics. She said that the party has not decided to nominate Mahinda Rajapaksa. She also noted that the former leader can make statement but no one takes notice and the party is of a separate stance. Former President Kumaratunga also provided lunch to the patients at the Minuwangoda District Hospital."}
