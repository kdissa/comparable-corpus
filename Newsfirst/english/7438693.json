Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne stated that the cabinet of ministers decided to stop importing Chinese cigarettes. Meanwhile, Minister Ravi Karunanayake responded to a question raised regarding the decision of the trade unions not to supply oil to generate electricity due to a problem raised on the repair of an oil pipeline. When questioned if the issue of the Petroleum Corporation was discussed, Minister Karunanayake noted that he does not have an issue and if those at the Petroleum Corporation had a problem they will present them. He added that they put forward the issue and have now realized that it is wrong. He said they got to know that permission has been granted in July, they will work on that. Journalists also questioned regarding their next presidential candidate. Karunanayake noted that they will present someone who can win, someone who loves the country, not someone who talks about drains and streams, someone who at least has passed the ordinary level exam. When questioned if the current Prime Minister is suitable, he responded saying that “he is also good”. When journalists questioned regarding Minister Premadasa’s name being put forward, he said he wants UNP to win and therefore will put forward a candidate who can win, not someone who just showcases on July 7th. United National Party General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam: Who is the Presidential Candidate in your party who failed the Ordinary Level examination? Reveal this before the country!"}
