Bids were called for the construction of a 300MW combined cycle power plant in Kerawalapitiya, recently. Member of the Cabinet appointed Procurement Committee and Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, Dr. Suren Batagoda later informed the CEB that LNG for the power plant would be supplied separately. The plan is to convert the plant into a LNG power plant after running it for three years as a diesel power plant. Dr. Batagoda had informed the CEB to inform the bidders regarding this plan as well. However, the Anti Corruption Front points out that when six investors have come forward to build an LNG power plant and provide electricity at a lower cost, it is baffling as to why such a decision has been taken. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya (Minister of Power and Renewable Energy) speaking on the issue said: [quote]”Various institutions as well as government officials have spoken regarding this tender process. As the Ministry, we hope to make a clear statement in this regard tomorrow”.[/quote]"}
