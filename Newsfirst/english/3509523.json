Minister of Housing and Samurdhi expressed the following views: ”Mind you the UN concept itself has certain inherent contradictions and weaknesses. If you examine the UN charter, it commences with the words sovereign equality of nations, sovereign equality of nation states. However, the main decision-making body of the UN consists of a group of super powers which in itself contradicts the stipulations of the UN charter. The charter also prohibits the international intervention in internal affairs of states. However when issues of peace and security are deemed important and prioritised in the political agenda this particular prohibition which inhibits states from interfering in the internal affairs of other states is conveniently pushed aside and the provision for the use of force come into operation.” Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and academic competition in which students learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. Community service awards, runner-up school awards and “Best School” Award were presented to the participants at the event."}
