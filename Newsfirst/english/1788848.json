When MP Wimal Weerawansa brought this matter up for debate, Minister Sagala Ratnayake challenged him and stated that the allegations were false. Sagala Ratnayaka, Minister of Ports and Shipping and Southern Development confidently challenged Wimal Weerawansa that he should resign from his position if he fails to back up his allegations. MP Wimal Weerawansa responded to Minister Sagala Ratnayaka at a meeting at Anamaduwa yesterday (March 31). Weerawansa said that he will prove it today(April 01) and that Ratnayaka must resign from his position. He said that he has a letter with the heading of the prime minister’s office. This letter is dated February 15th, 2019, and has been forwarded to W.H.Karunaratne, Secretary of the Ministry of Land and Parliamentary Reforms. R.Siriwardena, the national consultant coordinator at the Sri Lankan office of Millennium Challenge Cooperation has signed the document. The address stated in the letter is Second floor, New Building, North Wing, Temple Trees, Colombo 3. What do you have to say now Minister Sagala Ratnayaka? Rohitha Abeygunawardana UPFA MP said that if Minister Sagala Rathnayaka and MP Wimal Weerawansa were to debate this, Weerawansa will prove his point. “Based on the information we received, these activities take place at the Temple Trees. This is not an issue. During our government, I remember that a play was staged at Sirikotha. So those who engage in such activities are capable of doing anything.” He added."}
