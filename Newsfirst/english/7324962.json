The meeting was held with regard to an incident where the mobile phone of President’s Counsel, Rienzie Arsecularatne, rang in the Galle High Court, while court was in session. Secretary of the Lawyers’ Association of the Colombo High Court, Mohan Sellapperuma stated that the phone ringing inside the court was an accident, and that it would only be a fault if it was done on purpose. He added that this incident must be looked into on behalf of the general public, and not only lawyers. He went on to note that the Lawyers’ Association of the Colombo High Court would support the steps taken by any other association in this matter. He went on to note that the relevant organisations should jointly discuss this mater with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, the Judicial Services Commission and the Chief Justice, and urged that immediate steps be taken to rectify this situation."}
