Both posts linked to a heartfelt poem about his career. It was hosted by Derek Jeter’s site The Players’ Tribune and the site immediately buckled under all of the attention. I spoke with the company today about just how much Kobe Bryant’s announcement drove to his original post, and it was about 1 million clicks in the first two hours. I wonder how many attempts failed when the site crashed on and off for the first hour. I’m told that it was the most trafficked post to date, with over 750 sites linking to it thus far. Without Kobe’s post, the site is seeing success with nearly 2 million uniques a month and 4-5 minutes spent on the site for each story.
