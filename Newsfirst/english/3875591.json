Residents of Horowpothana, who engaged in the protests, stated that they are yet to receive compensation for damages caused to their properties. The protesters marched from the Horowpothana Bus Stand to the Horowpathana divisional secretariat to express their frustration. However the divisional secretary was not present at the office, so the enraged protestors contacted him over the phone. The divisional secretary noted that the funding for compensation should be approved by the Cabinet adding that the cabinet met for the first time today. He explained that this happened because the country went through a political crisis over the past two months. Another group staged a protest blocking the Mahiyanganaya-Kandy Main road. The protesters stated that they are facing problems irrigating farmlands due to a new construction which blocks a canal which carries water to their farmlands. One of the protestors speaking to the media stated that they expressed their concerns to Minister Lakshman Kiriella. The protestor explained that Kiriella had dismissed their claims and questioned how the construction is blocking the canal when water can flow underneath it."}
