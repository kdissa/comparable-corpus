Nimoy, 83, died on Friday of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is often caused by smoking. It is Jewish tradition for the dead to be buried within 24 hours but, as the practice is forbidden on a Saturday, the actor was laid to rest at 09:00 PST (17:00 GMT) on Sunday. However, his Star Trek co-star William Shatner was unable to attend. “I feel really awful,” tweeted the actor, who was committed to attend a Red Cross ball in Florida on Saturday night and could not fly back in time for the service. “Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried.” The star, also 83, received criticism for not rearranging his plans, but defended his decision online. “I chose to honour a commitment I made months ago to appear at a charitable fundraiser. A lot of money was raised,” he said. “So here I am; tell me off.” He added that his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth would attend the funeral. Source:BBC"}
