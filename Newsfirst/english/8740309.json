However, the mean solar day – the average length of a day, based on how long it takes Earth to rotate – is about 86,400.002 seconds long. That’s because Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing down a bit, due to a kind of braking force caused by the gravitational tug of war between Earth, the Moon and the Sun. Midnight came later on Tuesday as for the first time in the “leap second” means the last minute of June had 61 seconds in it. Leap seconds – and leap years – are added as basic ways to keep the clock in sync with the Earth and its seasons."}
