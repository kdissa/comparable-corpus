This morning the air quality index of Colombo stood at 163. Speaking to News 1st Senior Scientist of Air Quality Studies at the NBRO, H.D.S. Premasiri said: “Last few days the air quality level has gone up and last evening it has come to the normal level and today morning again, it has increased. These things happen due to the weather conditions and wind pattern around Sri Lanka. So time to time it goes up and down. These situations will be enhanced during the period of the northeast monsoon period close to the 15th of February. The last few days it was continuously high but now it is stepping down and varying depending on the wind pattern.” Meanwhile, according to researches, Pakistan’s Lahore was ranked 1st in the list of cities with the worst air, with an AQI score of 247. Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka and India’s Delhi were ranked second and third in the list with AQI scores of 227 and 224 respectively."}
