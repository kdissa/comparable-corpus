The State Minister of Highways stated that Ranil Wickremesinghe is not a factor for the development of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, but is an enemy and “he will show his colours next week when the new UNP board members are appointed and one section of the UNP will defect while Kabir Hashim will lose his position.” He  noted that when Akila and Sagala are appointed to those positions, there is a group that is waiting to join with President Maithripala Sirisena. “We must not anger these factors. I am blaming Chandrika. For her, Ranil is a factor and Mahinda is an enemy”, he said He pointed out that “she created the party and was the leader, but she is out-dated and for the members of the Joint Opposition, Maithripala Sirisena is a factor so do not make that factor an enemy.” The Minister also commented on the letter handed over to the General Secretary of the Inter Parliamentary Union, by Opposition MPs, stating that when coconuts were smashed, one lost his wallet and after that happened to Mahindananda, they went to Geneva with two bags and Bandula Gunawardena and Gammanpila lost their luggage and the letter had been handed over, even without them brushing their teeth. “I am not blaming them for going by. We too liked to undertake a visit or two while in the opposition”, charged the state minister"}
