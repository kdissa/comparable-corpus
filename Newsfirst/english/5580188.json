In a blog post the writer had said that HBO’s sixth season of the immensely popular show, scheduled to start in April, will almost certainly air before its source material is published. “ I am months away still … and that’s if the writing goes well. (Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn’t), ” he wrote. Criticizing himself on the post he also added that the writing of ‘The Winds of Winter’ is not going well. He went on to state in his post that “ I tried, I promise you. I failed. I blew the Halloween deadline, and I’ve now blown the end of the year deadline. And that almost certainly means that no, THE WINDS OF WINTER will not be published before the sixth season of GAME OF THRONES premieres in April, ” To the die-hard fans of the literary works that have been known for being quite uptight over their “television only” counterparts this comes as a massive blow and according to R.R.Martin “ inevitably, there will be certain plot twists and reveals in season six of GAME OF THRONES that have not yet happened in the books ,” but he reassured them stating that “ you can still enjoy the hell out of both .” Fans were very appreciative and supportive of Martin’s update.
