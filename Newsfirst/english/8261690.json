Arjuna Mahendran stated that a new circular will be sent by the end of this week to all commercial banks in Sri Lanka where they can allow the operation of RFC and NRFC accounts without any restrictions. He added that they are making them less tedious and more ordinary like a normal bank account where there is absolutely no restriction on anyone where they could deposit or withdraw. When questioned by the press on the issue of the allegations regarding the controversial bond issue earlier last year, the governor stated that the matter was taken up in the Supreme Court and judged that there had been no malfeasance. He also added that the newly appointed Committee on Public Enterprises will resume duties because investigations were halted since the Parliament was dissolved."}
