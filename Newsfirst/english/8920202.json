Dilshan was found to have breached Article 2.1.3 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “showing dissent at an umpire’s decision during an international match”. The incident happened in the fourth over, when Dilshan rubbed his elbow after the ball deflected off his gloves to the wicketkeeper to indicate that the ball had not touched his gloves. The charge was brought by on-field umpires Rod Tucker and Aleem Dar, third umpire Bruce Oxenford and reserve umpire Steve Davis. Last evening, Dilshan admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by David Boon of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees. “All Level 1 breaches for this offence carry a penalty of a warning/reprimand and/or the imposition of a fine up to 50 per cent of the applicable match fee,” the ICC stated. – Indianexpress"}
