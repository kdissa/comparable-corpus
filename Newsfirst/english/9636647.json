The daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori and a twice-defeated presidential candidate, Fujimori has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and described the prosecution’s efforts to imprison her to keep her from fleeing “political persecution.” Fujimori, 43, spent a week in police custody earlier this month before being released on appeal."}
