Subsequent to the programme, journalists quizzed Minister S.B. Dissanayake on a few current political matters. Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare S B Dissanayake noted that Dr. S.A. Wickremesinghe once said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is not a party, but a front or a force to be reckoned with so they are thinking about that. ”Conflict over opinions is nothing unusual for our party. So disciplinary action would be taken in order to unite the party not to chase away people. These are things which should be carefully dealt with”,  added Minister S B Dissanayake. Commenting on the recent Padha Yathra by the Joint Opposition,  the Minister said that it is something for them to be happy about. They expected around three to five million but witnessed a crowd of around 12,000 to 14,000; and around 100,000 were watching by the side of the road but around 2000 to 3000 showed up."}
