But…., what about the promises made to the people before this government came into office during the run up to the 2015 General Election? We at News 1st decided to piece together a ‘progress report’ on the government’s performance regarding those promises. We have 77 tasks listed down as promises given by the United National Front for Good Governance led by Ranil Wickremesinghe, the current Prime Minister. Two and a half years later, how many have they completed? – half? a quarter at least? Just 11 completed out of 11. Are they of ‘national importance’? Yes, a commission was established – But are they doing their job properly? According to sources, there are several cases at the Bribery Commission that are not even being looked into. Progress – Ultra Slow, at best. The Audit Act was a key promise made by the government. Transparency was promised. Good Governance was promised. The bill was debated. It looked like it is progressing. But will it ever come to life? According to the Auditor General, his draft has been amended a whopping 23 times. However, the introduction of a new constitution is on track. In other words, things that are easy to do and matters that are ‘beneficial’ to the government – has been completed. If the people of Sri Lanka were ‘Asian Parents’ and Government the ‘child’, the parents would be very disappointed! Oh wait…."}
