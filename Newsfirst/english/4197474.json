Two-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka was left close to tears in an emotional news conference as she tried to put into words how her form has deserted her. She was knocked out by Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva. In the men’s draw, there were also shocks as young guns Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev also suffered first-round defeats. The sixth and seventh seeds were bundled out within an hour of each other to Jiri Vesely and Thomas Fabbiano respectively."}
