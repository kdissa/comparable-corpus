The area residents claim that this plot of land in question belongs to the Coast Conservation Department and the Forest Department. Arugambay beach, a popular destination for surfing, is one of the most scenic beaches in South Asia. However, from time to time, various individuals attempt to carry out constructions and demarcate land plots. These attempts were made futile due to the protests of area residents. The area residents protested when a group that arrived with police officers, carried out construction activities at this location claiming that although they state that they possess a court order for such activities that they do not possess any such order."}
