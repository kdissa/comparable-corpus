Instead of conducting an inquiry into the complaints that were lodged, the Ministry of Education has turned a blind eye on the matter. Since inaction provides an impetus to further irregularities, the need for intervention at least at the last moment was highlighted by Action TV at a media briefing held on the 12th of January this year. Despite the assurance of the Minister of Education, an investigation into Ananda College is yet to be conducted. However 3 days prior to the enrolling of students to the school , the auditor generals department had undertaken an investigation over the enrolling process and sent an audit investigation report to the secretary of the ministry. The secretary is bound to respond to this report within 14 days. However 114 days have lapsed and no response in this regard has been given by the secretary, therefore it is quiet evident that the secretary to the ministry follows the same procedure as the minister. Hence according to this audit investigation report, it is evident that the enrolling of students to grade one is pre-planned and set."}
