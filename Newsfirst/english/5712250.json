The Parliamentarian stated that the government was put in a position to deal with a 41 billion loss due to interest during the four weeks from 27th of February to the 31st of March. The MP noted that as a result of this, people have been forced to bear an additional cost which amounts to 100 million rupees on a daily basis. Bandula Gunawardene also noted that the single digit interest rate which was maintained before, has now changed to double digits. The MP went on to say that this is not going to prevail for a short period but for 30 years. Parliamentarian G.L. Peiris too shared his views at the seminar which highlighted the controversial bond issue. He stated that money was taken from the Bank of Ceylon three days prior to this incident. The MP also questioned on how this damage will be rectified."}
