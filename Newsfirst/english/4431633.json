The minister was speaking at a rubber and palm oil workshop for regional plantation companies organised by the Plantation Managment Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Plantation Industries. Minister Dissanayake said the decision of banning particular weedicide had cost the industry Rs. 26 billion. He went on to say he always supported the idea that commercial agriculture needed weedicide. Furthermore, the minister spoke of developing the country’s rubber industry. The minister also noted that he will officially hand over responsibilities of developing the country’s rubber sector to his State Minister. Min. Dissanayake noted that he had taken this decision because he believed in devolving power. Dissanayake recalled how frustrating it was as a Deputy Minister to function without any assigned responsibilities. He noted that his past experiences, as well as added responsibilities both in the Government and the Party, prompted him to make this decision. (Watch the video for more…)"}
