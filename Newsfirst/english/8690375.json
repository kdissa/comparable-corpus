After talks with Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Paris, Mr Obama reaffirmed US support for “Turkey’s right to defend itself and its airspace”. But he stressed that Russia and Turkey should “de-escalate” their dispute. “We all have a common enemy,” Mr Obama said, referring to the so-called Islamic State (IS) group. “I want to make sure that we focus on that threat,” he said. “Turkey is a Nato ally,” he added. “And we’re very much committed to Turkey’s security and its sovereignty. We discussed how Turkey and Russia can work together to de-escalate tensions and find a diplomatic path to resolve this issue.” US defence secretary Ashton Carter later said Turkey had to do more to combat Islamic State militants , saying it had not effectively controlled its borders to stop the movement of IS fighters. Speaking in Washington, he urged Turkey to increase its resistance to the jihadists “both in the air and on the ground”. Mr Erdogan also spoke to reporters after Tuesday’s meeting with the US president. He said his government wanted to reduce tensions and was “determined to keep up the fight” against IS. Mr Obama and Mr Erdogan are among 150 leaders attending climate talks in Paris. -BBC"}
