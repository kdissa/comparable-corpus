The company said new video matching technology would alert selected content creators if their videos were reposted to Facebook without permission. In August, YouTube star Hank Green wrote a blog criticising the company over its slow response to video piracy. Facebook has been trying to grow its video business and in July it announced plans to share advertising revenue with content creators for the first time. In June, research by advertising agency Ogilvy found that 73% of the most popular videos on Facebook had been ripped from other websites. Announcing its new approach, Facebook said: “Our matching tool will evaluate millions of video uploads quickly and accurately, and when matches are surfaced, publishers will be able to report them to us for removal.” The new tool will be available to a “small group of partners” while the company improves the technology. However, unlike YouTube’s content ID system which can block infringing videos automatically, Facebook’s system will notify copyright holders and ask them if they want to remove the freebooted video."}
