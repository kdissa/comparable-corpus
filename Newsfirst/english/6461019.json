Gammadda V-Force voluntary movement was initiated on the 21st of July in 2018, with the participation of youth volunteers in the country. The first project was to conduct a clean-up operation at the World Heritage Sigiriya. Vforce teams then conducted many projects including clean up operation at the Negombo lagoon, planting trees beside Kalu Ganga in Ratnapura, renovation of the Giniwita Primary School in Kegalle, clean up operation at Mahapalugaswewa in Mahawa and planting trees at the Ella Forest Reserve. In addition, drug eradication programs and Dengue eradication programs were also carried out by Gammadda V-Force. V-Force Challenge Trophy was also introduced recently.

The Website will keep you updated on the upcoming Gammadda V-Force projects and you can also give us your feedback on the initiatives."}
