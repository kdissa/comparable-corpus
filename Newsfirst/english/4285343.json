The JVP Leader made this statement when addressing a media briefing held on Thursday. He said: They have been unable to reach an agreement on the 19th Amendment to the constitution even within the government. A situation has also been created where people are not receiving the benefits of concessions granted through the budget. He stated that a massive fraud is taking place at the Central Bank He said People who were defeated on the 8th of January, distasteful people who acted in a biased and insulting fashion, have been made stakeholders in the government. So,  the government is acting contradictory to the hopes of the Executive Council. This is completely in violation of the people’s mandate granted on the 8th of January. Dissanayake added that the Executive Council reached several decisions today.He stated that among the decisions, was that maximum support would be rendered to ensure passage of the 19th Amendment on   April 10, in line with the determination of the Supreme Court. The Executive Council has also decided to introduced the Right of Information Bill to Parliament on April  7 , 8,  9  and 10  and to convene the Consultative Committee on Mass Media to discuss it. Dissanayake added that the Executive Council had also decided to appoint a commission to prepare an electoral system which fairly represents the people’s choice."}
