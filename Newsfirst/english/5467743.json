Communications Director of the PUCSL Jayanath Herath noted that the CEB cannot initiate power cuts without prior permission. Upon inquiry from an official from the CEB regarding this incident, he added that the decision was taken immediately based on the power crisis without consulting PUC. He added that they were forced into taking this action since they had to protect the equilibrium of the National Grid. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy has notified that the existing power crisis will continue until mid-April. It has also come to light that according to the ministry’s media spokesperson, Sulakshana Jayawardena the process to purchase emergency power is underway."}
