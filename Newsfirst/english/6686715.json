A strike was carried out in Bastian Mawatha, Pettah which is the bus stop for private buses operating on long haul routes. Protesters demand that immediate solutions must be given to the 11 demands that they have put forth. Employees charge that they have held numerous discussions with relevant government officials however no solution has been provided. Employees also noted that they dislike wearing the uniform given to them and burnt uniforms in protest. Passengers from several areas across the country were severely inconvenienced due to protests conducted by private bus employees. News1stt cameras captured the manner in which SLTB buses were provided to avoid the inconvenience the passengers would have to face. Minister of internal transport Ranjith Maddumabandara, criticising the actions of the private bus employees, noted that they should not inconvenience the passengers and that this strike action is unfair."}
