The Prisons Commissioner General, T.M.J.W.Tennakoon had decided to take this measure due to the tension brewing up in the Negombo prison. 75 inmates have been transferred to the Anuradhapura prison, while the remainder have been transferred to the Wariyapola and Mahara prisons. The Commissioner General went on to note that the Defence Secretary has requested to provide additional security to 11 prisons including Welikada, Magazine, Negombo, Galle and Kalutara prisons.
