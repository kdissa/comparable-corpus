Speaking at the event, Minister of Higher Education Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that there is a huge gap between the country’s current education system and the generation of employment. “Though there is a major demand, there are no jobs. Although people are screaming for jobs for our youth, the honest truth is because of wrong political interpretations within the education system, the gap has only broadened more than narrowing.” He added: “They build schools to gain popularity but there are no equipment in the school. Qualified teachers are not provided, especially the science field. So ultimately what is left is a major social and economic crisis.”"}
