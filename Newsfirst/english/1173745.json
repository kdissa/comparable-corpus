In a short order dismissing Centre’s review petition, a three-judge bench headed by CJI said, “we find no merit in the review petition.” The apex court order comes as a relief to the three convicts, whose death sentence had been commuted to life in prison. Santhan, Murugan and Perarivalan had petitioned the apex court against their death sentence, arguing that there had been an exceptional delay in a decision on their mercy pleas. Rajiv Gandhi was killed by a suicide bomber at an election rally in Sriperumbedur, India on May 21, 1991. -Times of India"}
