The project is being implemented in Anuradhapura with the assistance of the World Bank at a cost of Rs.3 billion. Together with the inauguration, the renovation of the Mada Oya Wewa commenced. Wickremesinghe who addressed the gathering stated, “Projects at 700 tanks commenced this year, and by the end of August, the Pahala Malwathu Oya project will commence. Due to the drought and lack of fertilizer economy of villages suffered a downfall. We have arranged many programs to once again provide funds to villages. Only a few governments in this world can face challenges, we have built up one such a government.” Meanwhile, the Convenor of the National Peoples’ Council, Chameera Perera speaking at a media briefing spoke of the Prime Minister’s effort to develop tanks. He said that all of a sudden the Prime Minister says he will build 300 wewas in the upcoming four months which is only 100 days. He said that even the great King Parakramabahu was unable to achieve such a feat. The convenor requests the Prime Minister to stop joking with the procedure which has to be followed for such matters since there is a great irrigation system in the country. Perera humorously states that earlier it was tabs and now it has come down to wewa’s for Anuradhapura, all these miracles coming out of a person who has no democracy in his own party."}
