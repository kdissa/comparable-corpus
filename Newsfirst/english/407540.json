Durant, who became an unrestricted free agent on Sunday, is expected to miss most, if not all, of next season, however, while recuperating from a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered during this month’s NBA Finals defeat by Toronto. He made the announcement on Instagram. “Kevin Durant has confirmed he will sign a max deal with the Brooklyn Nets when the free agent moratorium period ends on July 6th,” said a post linked to his account. Durant is expected to sign a four-year deal worth $164 million, according to ESPN. The 30-year-old has averaged 27 points and 7.1 rebounds during his 12 seasons in the NBA. He won two championships in his three seasons with Golden State, and his departure leaves a gaping hole in the roster at a team that has played in the past five NBA Finals."}
