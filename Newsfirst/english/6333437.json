The petition was filed by MPs Udaya Gammanpila and Sisira Jayakody. Speaking to the media MP Gammanpila said that Sri Lanka was betrayed to America by many actions such as the government agreeing to provide the US with an economic corridor from Colombo to Trincomalee which is the Millenium Challenge Compact agreement. He further said that the strategy followed in this process is that lands will be provided to the public as private property and will then be encouraged to sell them to the US and US corporations at a higher price. Gammanpila stated that since the matter pertains to lands that the constitution dictates that it should be referred to the Provincial Councils first which has not happened. He added that through the petition that every section of the bill is in violation of the constitution."}
