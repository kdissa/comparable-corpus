The president said, he was proud of progress made towards safeguarding the freedom, sovereignty, territorial integrity of the nation and strengthening national reconciliation and economic and political rights of all sri lankan citizens. He added that this occasion is of special significance because the nation commemorates the dawn of freedom at a time coinciding with the taking of clear and resolute steps to firmly establish democracy and good governance, the rule of law, and a truly meaningful parliamentary system. The president said the government has resolved to continue on this path to create a socio-political environment for all citizens to live securely, without fear. Meanwhile, in a separate Independence Day message, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said, it is a historic triumph for all Sri Lankans to be able to celebrate the 68th Independence Day as a nation that prices the values of democracy, bringing all its citizens together in a spirit of unity and strength. The Prime Minister went on to say that, just as everyone stood together to set the country free from the grip of colonialism, on January 8, Sri Lankans came together to set the nation free from the tyranny of dictatorship, corruption, nepotism and familial rule, ensuring Sri Lankaâ€™s return to the community of democratic nations that assure its people freedom and justice. The Prime Minster added, now the task before Sri Lanka is to ensure that the hard-won freedom retains its meaning and significance. He said, this was a task that calls for all Sri Lankans to be united, irrespective of religious, ethnic and political affiliations. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe ended his Independence Day message, calling all Sri Lankans to strive to understand the challenges before us as a nation, and determine to give of itself wholeheartedly to a noble vision of taking Sri Lanka forward."}
