London came first in the study for the second year in a row. Bangkok lost its first place ranking in 2013, largely due to political unrest and Singapore has slipped two spots in Mastercard’s Global Destination Cities Index. The city-state is ranked as the 7th most visited city in the world this year, down from 5th place in 2014. Incidentally Asian cities continue to dominate the annual MasterCard Global Destinations Cities Index, making up half of the top ten. The MasterCard Index of Global Destination Cities ranks cities in terms of the number of their total international overnight visitor arrivals and the cross-border spending by these same visitors in the destination cities, and gives visitor and passenger growth forecasts for 2015. However London and Bangkok have topped the Index throughout its five year history. The rivalry is set to continue as Bangkok’s visitor numbers continue to recover following civil unrest in 2014. 1. London – 18.82 million 2. Bangkok – 18.24 million 3. Paris – 16.06 million 4. Dubai – 14.26 million 5. Istanbul – 12.56 million 6. New York – 12.27 million 7. Singapore – 11.88 million 8.
