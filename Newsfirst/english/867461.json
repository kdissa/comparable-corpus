The lawsuit, filed months after Facebook (FB, Tech30) acquired Oculus in 2014, claimed Oculus founder Palmer Luckey and CTO John Carmack stole proprietary information and used it to make Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset partially responsible for launching the concept into the mainstream. The Dallas-based jury ruled on Wednesday Luckey violated a non-disclosure agreement. However, it said Oculus did not steal trade secrets misappropriate intellectual property as the suit alleges. Facebook isn’t on the hook for all of the damages. As Polygon reports, Oculus will pay $200 million for non-disclosure agreement violations and $50 million for copyright infringement. Oculus and Luckey are both responsible for $50 million for misrepresenting the origin of a product. Former CEO Brendan Iribe — who now leads a PC VR division within Facebook — must also pay $150 million. Oculus plans to appeal the ruling. Courtesy – CNN"}
