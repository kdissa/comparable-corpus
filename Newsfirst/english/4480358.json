After both sides finished level on 154, Chris Jordan’s yorkers restricted Pakistan to 3-1 in their extra over. England had only two from four balls, but, in increasing tension, Eoin Morgan took the winning runs from the fifth. James Vince earlier made 46 in England’s 154-8, while Shoaib Malik’s 75 got Pakistan to 154-7. The win in Sharjah completes an excellent limited-overs tour for England, who followed a 2-0 Test series defeat with a 3-1 win in the one-day internationals. That Pakistan managed to get the scores level was down to the flaying of Malik and the impetus of Afridi. When Afridi walked to the crease, Pakistan, who had previously slipped to 11-3, were 65-5 and in need of 90 from 53 balls. As he did in the second T20, captain Afridi dragged his side into contention, hitting three sixes – including one that went out of the ground – in his 20-ball 29. When he lost his leg stump to a David Willey slower ball, England looked back in control, yet Malik continued to edge Pakistan closer. With 11 needed from the final over, Sohail Tanvir hit Woakes for six, only for Malik to hole out off the penultimate ball with two still required. Pakistan could only scramble a bye from the final ball, sending the match into overtime."}
