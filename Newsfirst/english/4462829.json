He added that the investigation will only conclude when the people who swindled all the money pay them back to the people and legal action is taken against them He further called for an environment where people who put the country in such a damaging situation will not go scot-free and such fraud will not be entertained.

He pointed out however that this will only stop once constitutional and legal measures are taken with regard to such acts."}
