During the UN Secretary General’s visit to the governor’s office, a group of relatives of missing persons held a demonstration opposite the office and handed over a petition to a representative of the UN Secretary General. Afterwards Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran, and other representatives of the Tamil National Alliance, at the premises of the Jaffna Library. A demonstration was held there as well by relatives of missing persons, and family members of those who have been arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Following the meeting, the opposition leader attempted to meet with the demonstrators but the attempt proved futile as a result of strong objections. Subsequently, the UN Secretary General met with the people who have been relocated in Thellipalei and Weemankamam areas."}
