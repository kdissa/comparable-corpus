Sampanthan had assured that the new constitution will preserve the unitary, and undivided status of the country. JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake expressing his views on the new constitution stated that racist groups have stated that a new constitution would be presented before the 4th of February. However, Dissanayake explained that a new constitution cannot be formulated simply by the thoughts that pop up in Ranil Wickramasinghe’s, Mahinda Rajapaksa’s or even their heads. He noted that the current parliament is not competent enough to formulate a new constitution."}
