Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill led the service which was attended by several hundred people including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and his wife Svetlana, and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin. Easter is Christianity’s most important holiday which symbolises the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Holy Fire from Jerusalem was delivered to Moscow late on Saturday (April 30) and was carried by priests around the cathedral after which the Patriarch announced the resurrection of Christ with greeting: “Christ has risen!” Easter greetings were later offered to the congregation inside the cathedral. The Holy Fire is lit every year at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem on the day preceding Orthodox Easter and is believed by Orthodox Christians to be a miracle. Once lit in Russia’s main cathedral in Moscow, the Holy Fire is traditionally delivered to regional centres across Russia. ."}
