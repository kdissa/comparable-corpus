It is an assembly dominated by MPs from Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD), which won 80% of elected seats in November’s poll. The session on Monday marks a historic turnaround for the National League for Democracy (NLD) party, which for years was suppressed by the military. But a quarter of all seats are reserved for the military, which also retains control of key ministries. One of the new parliament’s first jobs will be to choose a new president."}
