The minister noted that the government should not be frightened by political movements that are struggling hard to give birth to an “under-developed child.” ”This is how cripples are born. Such political movements have very narrow motives. This party is alive, it cannot be easily broken by anyone. Whatever challenge we have to face, we will contest the next local government polls under the symbol of the hand”, added Minister Wijiyamuni Soysa."}
