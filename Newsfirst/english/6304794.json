However, an uncertain situation has arisen as to whether Sri Lanka will actually be able to host the youth games.This is because, the Asian Olympic Committee has voiced their dissatisfaction of Sri Lanka’s lack of preparation to host the games. A delegation of the Asian Olympic Committee had recently toured Hambantota on an inspection to see how Sri Lanka is preparing for the games, after a time lapse of two years had passed since being named as the host country. Based on the inspection, the committee attending a media briefing made a statement suggesting that they are not satisfied with Sri Lanka’ s preparation. Therefore, the committee had decided to give Sri Lanka a concessionary three months to arrange the groundwork , before a final decision is taken on the hosting of the Asian Youth Games. When Newsfirst made an inquiry regarding the matter, Director General of Sports, Ranjani Jayakody confirmed the situation."}
