A sum of Rs.4 million was allocated for the construction of this building under the “ Sidu Daham Sevana ” Program with provision from the Central Cultural Fund. Minister Sajith Premadasa, speaking at the event stated that they are deploying various programs for the development of Dhamma education adding that those who looted public funds are attempting to sabotage those programs. He reasoned that those who looted public funds and exploited the public property acted on behalf of their personal benefit without thinking about the country or its people. The Government has directly intervened to build Dhamma education in the country for the first time, he added. “Sadly, those who cannot be pleased with it are making attempts to ruin it”, the Minister continued."}
