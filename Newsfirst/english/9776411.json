They point out that various techniques are being used by smugglers to evade authorities. The two main access points used by the smugglers to bring drugs in to the country are the airport and the sea route. One of the conclusions that News 1st was able to reach after almost a month of investigations is that all drugs smuggled through airports and sea cannot be traced. The most recent incident was when six institutions, including the Sri Lanka Police, were carried out an investigation into a ship suspected to have smuggled drugs in to the country. Fishermen say the trade or deal takes place in the middle of the sea. When News 1st carried out further investigations, it was revealed that drugs including heroin, Kerala Ganja and others are traded in seas off Chilaw. They say that in such a backdrop, even if a ship is brought into the harbor for a search, there would be no trace of drugs."}
