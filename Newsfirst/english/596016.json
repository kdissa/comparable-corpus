Davies made 115 off 117 deliveries and Sangakkara fired 109 from 104 balls as the pair put on 204 runs for the second wicket before the hosts reached 326-6. Derbyshire captain Wes Durston hit five sixes in his 98-ball innings of 129, but his side could only make 249. James Burke was the pick of the Surrey bowlers, taking 5-28 in his side’s win. Surrey, whose total was the sixth highest in the competition this season, have now won all four of their One-Day Cup matches that have been completed – with one game abandoned – and remain two points clear at the top. Davies’s century continued his excellent form in the tournament after he had scored 99 versus Northants and 98 against Durham. Surrey play bottom-placed side Worcestershire at the Oval on Tuesday while Derbyshire entertain Leicestershire on the same day. -BBC"}
