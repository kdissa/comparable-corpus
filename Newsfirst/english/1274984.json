Out of 350 members of parliament, 180 lawmakers voted in favour the no-confidence motion, 169 voted against, and one abstained. Rajoy is one of Europe’s longest serving heads of government and the first prime minister to be ousted in a no-confidence vote since Spain transitioned to democracy in 1977. Rajoy has been prime minister since 2011. Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez will become prime minister, BBC reports. “We’re going to sign a new page in the history of democracy in our country,” Sánchez said ahead of the vote."}
