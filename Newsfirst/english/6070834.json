The meeting was attended by UNP members and was held last evening in the Bomiriya area in Kaduwela. Equipment was donated during the meeting to the Bomiriya Rassapana Welfare Committee. The minister stated, “Profits of all profit-making institutions have fallen by 20 percent. There is no increase of Rs.1200  in the salary. It will be removed as they please.
