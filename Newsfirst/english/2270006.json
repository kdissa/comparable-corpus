Perera commented on the recent protest march organized by the SLPP and Joint Opposition in Colombo. Perera noted that the rally was not as big as the organizers expected it to be. According to the State Minister, only around 3,000 people gathered at the Viharamahadevi Park. He explained that the low turn out was because certain groups within the SLPP and Joint Opposition had boycotted the rally. Perera stated that the group supporting Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the group that opposes Mahinda Rajapaksa did not attend the rally. He noted that the rally provided proof that there was a clear division in the Joint Opposition."}
