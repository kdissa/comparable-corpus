Jolie, 39, was recently in Australia directing the war drama Unbroken, while Pitt, 50, was working in the UK for his role as a tank commander in Fury, which is set in 1945. The actress told Australia’s TV Week magazine: “He was supportive from a distance and it was quite romantic in a way. “We decided to be of that time when we could imagine he was in the European theatre and I was in the Pacific theatre and we wrote hand-written letters to each other that were very connecting for us, thinking of the people that were separated for months if not years at a time back then.” Unbroken tells the story of Second world War hero, Japanese prisoner of war camp survivor, and former Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini, who died on July 2 at the age of 97. Jolie, who had a preventative double mastectomy last year, described showing Zamperini the film in his hospital bed."}
