While noting that the draft bill for the act was presented during his administration as well, Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa stated that he handed the entire process over to the monks and stepped away from it. Rajapaksa believes that if he had taken any decisions on the draft bill it could have been interpreted in the wrong way. He added that since it was a matter that was favored by the Mahanayake theros and not favored by the other monks, it was best for both groups to come together and resolve the matter."}
