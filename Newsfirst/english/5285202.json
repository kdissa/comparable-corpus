This is a dirty alliance.[/quote] Minister of Special Projects,  S.M. Chandrasena convened convened a special media briefing in Anuradhapura on Sunday evening. “There is talk of a forming of a new alliance. It is a dirty alliance. They couldn’t do anything for eleven years when that President was in power; they did nothing for the country. They couldn’t even protect their own party. Their cadre dropped to just 52 MPs. When this alliance is formed, the people will know what this alliance will do. Afterwards only the gods can save us. There is nothing new to say about it. However, the forming of an alliance is good for the government. We will not need to campaign for elections. The people will know what those in that alliance are capable of.”"}
