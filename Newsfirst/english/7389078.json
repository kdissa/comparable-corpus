Both Thirimanne and his opening partner T.M. Dilshan were dismissed for golden ducks in the game against Afghanistan which Sri Lanka won by 4 wickets . Speaking on the Sri Lankan top order, Thirimanne expressed delight that all 4 of the Sri Lankan top order batsmen are in form. However he cautioned that this is not the end and that they needed to perform equally well against Australia. Meanwhile England’s Eoin Morgan said that they didn’t put sides under pressure and create opportunities when bowling in today’s game. Morgan noted that the English bowlers failed to put pressure on the Sri Lankan batsmen today and this led to their failure."}
