The incident comes four days into a strike action launched by the Railway Crossing Gate-keepers Association. The accident occurred when the woman was travelling on a motorbike with her two children at the railway crossing in the Edagala Junction in Hiriyala. The three victims were run over by an express train which was plying from Kankesanthurai to Colombo on Wednesday afternoon while one of the children was being taken for a tuition class. This warning sign bears testament that there was no attendant to close the gates at the time of the accident.The woman and two children died on the spot. Their bodies were brought to the Ganewatte Railway Station in the same train that ran them over. The woman, aged 32, was Deepani Dilrukshi, a resident of Nikawewa, Ulpathgama, Kurunegala. Her eldest daughter, Ruvindra Tharushi was a grade one student at the Ambagaswewa Maha Vidyalaya while her younger sibling, Dhaham Priyanka was one  a year old. The father of these children, who serves in the Sri Lanka Army, reported back to his duties yesterday after completing his leave. At the time of the accident, a group of bamboo railway crossing gate-keepers, who are into the fourth day of their strike action, were staging a demonstration obstructing the Northern Railway Line. Train services along the Northern Railway Line were disrupted for several hours owing to the protest which is being staged demanding that they be recruited as permanent employees. Even though the demonstration came to a conclusion later in the evening, the strike action is still in effect."}
