Speaking at international talks on climate change in Paris, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the downing of the plane a “huge mistake”. Turkey has denied any ties to IS and is part of a US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against the militant group. The Turkish government has refused to apologise for the incident. One Russian pilot was killed and the other rescued following the crash on 24 November. Turkey says the jet entered its air space – an accusation Russia denies. On Monday the US state department said evidence from Turkish and US sources indicated the aircraft did violate Turkish airspace. Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria, targeting rebels against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, including IS. Turkey is a vehement opponent of Mr Assad and has been accused of turning a blind eye to jihadist fighters crossing from its territory into Syria. Until a few months ago, Turkey was reluctant to play an active role in the coalition against IS. However, in August it allowed the US-led coalition to begin using its airbase at Incirlik. Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey over the downing of the plane, including restrictions on imports of Turkish food and an end to visa-free travel. IS earns much of its money from illegal sales of oil – however, Turkey has staunchly denied that it is involved in the trade. Earlier Turkish Prime Minster Ahmet Davutoglu said the incident was unfortunate but that Turkey had a right and duty to protect its airspace and would not apologise."}
