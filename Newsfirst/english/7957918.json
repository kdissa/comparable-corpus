The party leaders meeting was held at the parliamentary complex today under the auspices of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. It was agreed at the meeting that the appropriation bill will be presented to Parliament on the 05th of February. The Budget Speech was scheduled for the 05th of March. Speaking to the media following the meeting, Chief Opposition Whip MP Mahinda Amaraweera stated that during the meeting they called on the Speaker to ensure that Mahinda Rajapaksa receives the opportunity to serve as the Opposition leader. The MP noted that the Speaker agreed to this request and that they took steps to inform the Secretary to the Opposition leader of the Speaker’s decision. Amaraweera confirmed that Mahinda Rajapaksa would assume duties as the Opposition leader at both the office in Colombo and the one in Parliament on Monday or Tuesday. When questioned whether the Speaker had issued the letter removing the former Opposition leader from the position, Amaraweera noted that he was not aware of it and explained that the courts will have to get involved if a decision beyond this is required. Amaraweera believes that this will not cause any problems as members of the Government were also present when the speaker delivered his verdict. When asked whether an issue was raised regarding Mahinda Rajapaksa’s obtaining SLPP membership, the MP responded by saying that the Speaker had accepted his letter, as the General Secretary of the UPFA, stating that MR remains a member of the UPFA."}
