He noted that if a legal government brings forth the proposal and subject it to approval with two third of the majority, it is possible to dissolve parliament and hold elections before the time period of four and a half years. He stated that this was decided by both ruling party and opposition of Britain’s parliament through the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in 2011. “The Prime Minister alone cannot request the queen to dissolve parliament. That power has been removed. The power to dissolve parliament is now vested in the parliament. I am not aware of the law system in Kosovo, and those who speak of Kosovo are not aware of its location either,” said Ranil Wickremesinghe. He requested the President and the so called ministers to act constitutionally. He noted that if the constitution cannot be protected then they have no right to remain here. Meanwhile, Deputy Leader of the UNP Sajith Premadasa stated that the reason they boycotted parliament was that they did not have the majority. “113 MPs are needed to claim the majority. I believe that our opponent is unable to gather even 75 MPs. That is the truth,” said Sajith Premadasa. He requested the president to act constitutionally, and allow them, who has the majority, to continue the government, in its previous state, prior to the 26th of October."}
