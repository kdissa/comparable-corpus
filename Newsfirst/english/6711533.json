After paying his respects at the Kirivehera in Kataragama last evening (December 31), he then proceeded to the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya to receive blessings. He then attended an event held at the Vajiragiriya Maha Vihara in Tangalle this morning (January 1). Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa then presented 100 food hampers to pregnant mothers sponsored by local voluntary organizations. Speaking to the media he noted: “In this New Year, I feel it will be a year where the President will fulfil promises he has made to the people. We are still a minority government. We have not established a government yet. Even though we have a government, the opposition consists of a larger part of parliament.We can only establish a proper government after the upcoming general elections. I remind you that it is a year where elections will happen and promises will be fulfilled.”"}
