They are suspected of awarding regulatory favours to the Bezeq telecom firm in return for positive media coverage of the couple. Mr Netanyahu rejected the allegations in the co-called Case 4000. The Israeli attorney-general will now have to decide whether to bring charges in the case. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said: “These recommendations were determined and leaked even before the investigations began. “I’m sure that in this case the relevant authorities, after examining the issue, will reach the same conclusion: that there was nothing because there is nothing.” In February, police recommended indicting Mr Netanyahu in two other corruption investigations. He had dismissed all the allegations as “baseless”. Israeli media say Mr Netanyahu has been questioned by investigators a number of times. The prime minister, 69, heads a fragile coalition, but he appears confident the allegations will not spur early elections. The next legislative poll is scheduled for November 2019. Mr Netanyahu is in his second stint as prime minister. Courtesy to BBC News"}
