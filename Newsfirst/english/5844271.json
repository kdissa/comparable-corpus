Trade unions point out that the action will continue until they receive an appropriate solution. The strike was launched on Wednesday (Jan 30) against the appointment of a retired Navy officer to the post of Director General of customs. It is in this backdrop that steps were taken on Thursday to appoint  H.G. Sumanasinghe as the acting director of customs. However, Customs trade unions have rejected this move as well and have stated that they do not accept the appointment as it is illegal."}
