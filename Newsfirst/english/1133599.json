L. Peiris stated that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is working according to his own agenda. He further commented stating that the streets of Colombo are full of posters hailing Karu Jayasuriya as the greatest hero since King Dutugemunu and that it is an absolute nonsense. He went on to state that the speaker has been acting in a totally illegal manner and that now it seems that he has falsified official government documents. He noted that the Hansard approved by the Speaker contains a sentence which is not there in the video footage which is a live record of parliamentary proceedings prepared by non-other than the officials of the parliament. He then stated that it is the best possible evidence of what transpired in parliament and there is a discrepancy between that and the version of Hansard approved by the speaker."}
