China stated it would place a 25% trade tariffs on 106 US goods. They include soybeans, cars and orange juice. The move came just hours after the Trump administration detailed its plan to impose tariffs on a similar value of Chinese-made aircraft parts, cars and car parts, televisions, steel and much more. Though the tariffs are not in place yet, the news had an immediate impact on markets, The Washington Post reports.
