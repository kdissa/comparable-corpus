Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith speaking at the discussion said: I wish to know, at this instance, whether there is no system in place to expedite their trials via court and issue verdicts? Isn’t there a violation of human rights taking place for each day that they are detained? Speaking further, the  Minister of Justice noted that a special high court has been established in Anuradhapura to expedite the trials and that is already happening. The Minister added that there are also cases which have been filed at the Colombo High Court."}
