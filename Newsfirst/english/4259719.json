During the meeting, bus owners made a request from the minister to change the Semi Luxury Service to Express, Limited Stop bus service. However, as the bus fare would not change the minister declined the request. Minister declared that if the semi-luxury bus service is to remain in effect the bus owners would have to carry the number of seated passengers which has been recommended by the National Transport Commission. In addition, the minister stated that the semi-luxury buses will have to be equipped with headrests and will have to stop at limited bus halts. However, the representatives did not comment on the matter and therefore the minister stated that he would provide them a week to come up with a decision."}
