However, no one even thought of this until officials of Gammadda intervened. The construction of a brand new community hall as a replacement of the old and dilapidated hall, was carried out through the Gammadda nation building initiative, and was declared open to its people on Sunday. The Nabadagaswewa community hall was constructed with  the financial support of ICL Marketing Pvt Ltd which is a subsidiary of the Capital Maharaja Organisation Limited. The people of Kuttikullam, Kilinochchi were used to purchasing water.They had to face many sufferings as a result. Many villagers were diagnosed with chronic kidney disease due to the lack of consumption of water. Thirst is something the people of this village have had to inherit from generation to generation.But  today, the fate of 200 families were changed. Through Gammadda, the nation building initiative, these villagers now have access to clean drinking water.The water project for this village was sponsored by the Gabo Trust Fund. The construction process was handled by the Sri Lanka Navy."}
