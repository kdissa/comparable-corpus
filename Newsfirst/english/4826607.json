Some reports say the attack was by Syrian or Russian warplanes but this has not been confirmed. The planes attacked the Kamuna camp next to Sarmada village in the northern countryside of Idlib province on the border with Turkey, according to the observatory. The bombing was part of heavy fighting that erupted in Syria a day after the United States and Russia brokered a ceasefire for Aleppo, one of the country’s most war-torn cities, and surrounding areas. The top United Nations humanitarian official has called for an immediate, impartial and independent investigation into the air strikes that today left dozes of civilians dead and injured in the northern Syrian Governorate of Idleb, which, if found to be deliberate, could amount to a war crime. An estimated 400,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the UN, with millions more diplaced internally and in neighbouring states. Also UN has warned that if the nationwide cessation fails, it will be “catastrophic” and could send 400,000 more people heading for refuge at the border with Turkey. The crisis has also given rise to the European refugee crisis."}
