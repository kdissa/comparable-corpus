The internal security ministry said that some of the suspects were arrested while trying to flee to neighbouring Somalia. At least 148 people , mostly students were killed when gunmen attacked a university campus in Garissa. Al-Shabab has since pledged a “long, gruesome war” against Kenya. The militant group said its attacks were in retaliation for acts by Kenya’s security forces, who are part of the African Union’s mission in Somalia against al-Shabab. -BBC"}
