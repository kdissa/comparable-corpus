The child had been abducted after the individual had said that the girl’s mother had asked him to bring the child home. The individual was caught by locals while at a shrubbery area close to the Puttlam -Tiladiya railway line. The locals stated that they caught him while he was taking the girl in to the woods. The 8-year-old, girl who always travels home by three-wheeler after school, had been conned by this individual before being abducted. A woman who had seen the girl travelling with an unknown person had informed of this to the girl’s mother over the telephone. At that time, the man had taken the girl in to the woods near the Tiladiya Railway line. The quick intervention of the locals prevented what could have been a very traumatic experience for the young girl, who was later handed over to the parents. According to police, the arrested suspect was a well-known felon in the area."}
