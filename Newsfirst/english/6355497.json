The cause of the blast is not clear and it is not known if anyone was hurt. Nasa said SpaceX was test-firing a rocket which was due to take a satellite into space this weekend. A dense plume of black smoke filled the air following the blast, television images showed. The US space agency NASA said the incident took place shortly after 9:00 am (1300 GMT). The force of the blast shook buildings several miles away. Local emergency officials described the incident as a “catastrophic abort during a static test fire”."}
