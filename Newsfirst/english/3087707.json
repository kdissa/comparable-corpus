Since the allocation of fuel to the CEB on a credit basis had exceeded, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has decided to stop providing fuel required for the Kerawalapitiya Power Plant. Thereby the power generation at the Kerawalapitiya Power plant has come to a halt. As a result, the CEB has decided to carry out a daily power cut of 2 hours. In a statement issued by the Ministry of Power and Energy said that Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had intervened into this issue and advised the CEYPETCO to continue to provide fuel to the CEB. It added that this directive was provided subject to the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers."}
