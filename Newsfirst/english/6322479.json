Waste was released to the Kumbukkan Oya from the Albesia Power Plant of the Ceylon Electricity Board. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board said, therefore, the supply of water to the Moneragala Town and surrounding areas was suspended. The Disaster Management Centre said as a result around 50,000 families in Moneragala, Madulla and Okkampitiya will thus be affected and measures are underway to provide water using bowsers."}
