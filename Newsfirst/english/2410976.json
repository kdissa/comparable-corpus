The 37-year-old Ajmal, once Pakistan’s most potent wicket-taker, has struggled since returning to international cricket from a ban for an illegal bowling action. As fast bowlers Rahat Ali and Sohail Khan and batsman Sohaib Maqsood are yet to recover from their injuries and missed out on selection, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement. However Rahat Ali, Sohail Khan and Sohaib Maqsood are expected to return to the team soon. “Selection committee has also kept its options open in case of need for the 16th member keeping in mind the extreme weather conditions in Sri Lanka.” Meanwhile the first Test begins at Galle from June 17 and Pakistan will also play five one-day internationals and two Twenty20s. Squad: Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Shan Masood, Azhar Ali, Misbah-ul-Haq (captain), Younis Khan, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Sarfraz Ahmed, Yasir Shah, Zulfiqar Babar, Wahab Riaz, Junaid Khan, Imran Khan, Ehsan Adil"}
