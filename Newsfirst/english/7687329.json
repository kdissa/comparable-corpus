Rajoy left the parliament before the session ended and was believed to have met with members of his government to discuss the possible outcome of the no-confidence vote he is facing. Pedro Sanchez was almost certain to become Spain’s new Prime Minister after his socialist party on Thursday secured enough votes to topple Mariano Rajoy in a confidence vote over a corruption case. The vote is due to take place on Friday (May 31). However, Rajoy will not resign ahead of the no-confidence vote according to the Secretary-General of his People’s Party (PP), Maria Dolores de Cospedal."}
