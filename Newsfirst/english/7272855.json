The procession reached the temple in the midst of devotees who had gathered to pay homage to the relics. The sacred SarvagnaÂ relics and the relics of Maha Rahath theros which will be placed at the Vesak Zone commemorating the three stages of the life of Lord Buddha were carried in a procession from Kandy. Subsequent to the Theva ceremony, held at the Nelligala International Buddhist Centre , the procession reached Kelaniya after travelling for four days along a route of 204 kilometres. Devotees in their large numbers lined up the streets to pay homage to the sacred relics across all the villages and cities the procession passed over the past four days. Floral tributes were paid by air when the procession carrying the sacred relics reached Kadawatha. The initiative was organised by the Kadawatha United Trade Union this time as well. Meanwhile, preparations are currently underway for the Vesak Zone in Braybrooke Place in Colombo 02. // <![CDATA[(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));// ]]&gt; Procession carrying Sacred Relics to Sirasa Vesak Zone reaches KelaniyaRead More : http://goo.gl/1tAJUc Posted by Newsfirst.lk on Saturday, May 2, 2015"}
