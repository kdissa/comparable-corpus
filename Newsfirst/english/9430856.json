On the 30th of July, they handed in a letter to the Speaker of Parliament, requesting him to once again consider granting the position of Opposition Leader to the Joint Opposition. The letter contains the names of 70 MPs and signatures of 8 MPs whom they claim support their bid for the position of Opposition leader. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, in turn, had inquired about the matter from the UPFA General Secretary, Min. Mahinda Amaraweera. The speaker made this inquiry because the joint opposition members are still recognized as UPFA MPs by the Parliament. Speaking to News1st Min Mahinda Amaraweera accepted that he had received a letter from the Speaker in this regard and noted that the UPFA cannot hold the position of Opposition Leader as it is currently part of the Government. Amaraweera expressed confidence that the current opposition leader would be able to fulfill the required duties. MP Dilan Perera, a member of the SLFP 16 that left the Government recently, requested Mahinda Amaraweera to forget about writing a letter to the speaker on the Opposition Leader, instead, he requested that Amaraweera writes to the speaker of Parliament stating that the UPFA is withdrawing from the Government. Dilan Perera noted that when this happens, it is the UNP General Secretary who would have to reach a decision on the post of Opposition Leader while they will have to figure out the members of cabinet under Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa."}
