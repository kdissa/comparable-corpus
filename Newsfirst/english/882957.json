The three accused are Sri Lankan nationals. Investigations have begun based on the information shared by the Korean authorities. The Korean legal system has a statutory limit for the prosecution of any rape cases, thus when the case was taken up 12 years later by the Thegu Courts it was dismissed. Investigations into the incident that occurred 19 years ago, were abandoned halfway due to the lack of evidence to match DNA samples found on the clothes of the rape victim. However, it was in 2010 that the suspects were unveiled when a Sri Lankan had been brought before Thegu courts for harassing an under aged girl. Twelve years after this incident, in 2010 a Sri Lankan individual employed in Korea was arrested over molesting an underaged girl. DNA sample that the Korean authorities had obtained from the suspect, later revealed that it was a match to the DNA found on the clothes of the rape victim in 1998."}
