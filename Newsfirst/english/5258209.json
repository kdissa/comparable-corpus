To pay homage to the King of Pop on his birth anniversary on August 29, Maati Baani, “a world music duo” as they call themselves, produced a wonderful cover of Michael Jackson’s 1991 hit Heal The World. This rendition of the song features 45 child artistes from across the globe, all performing together for this lovely track. Among them are singers and guitarists from the US and Canada, a harpist from Russia, a piano player from India, a drummer from Japan, a table player from India, tap dancers and a violinist from the US, and choirs from the US and South Africa. The song begins with a kid drumming on a washing machine. This is truly a global musical collaboration. Because nothing heals the world better than with the gift of music. Source : NDTV"}
