The Parliamentary Special Committee has called for a report regarding the funds received by the Batticaloa Campus. Under the condition of anonymity, the senior Central Banker said the money had come to the Bank of Ceylon as a ‘remittance’. He added that it is believed these funds were assumed to be “workers remittances” Investigations are now being carried out as to whether the banking system at the BOC has the capacity to recognize transactions such as this and for the appropriate red flags to be raised and/or whether this transaction has been classified wrongfully. The senior CBSL official added that the money has not come through the Central Bank. Meanwhile, MLAM Hizbullah says that he plans to open the university on the 3rd of January 3rd 2020.
