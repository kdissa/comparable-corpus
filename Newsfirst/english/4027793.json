But the company replaced that truck’s drivetrain with an electrically-driven rear axle that is based on the one used by the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hybrid bus. Three lithium-ion battery modules that make up the whole battery pack will power the truck, and it’s located underneath where the cargo would go."}
