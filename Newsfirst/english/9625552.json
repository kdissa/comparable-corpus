The supersonic skydiver made history in October 2012 when he plunged more than 24 miles to Earth’s surface, breaking three records in the process. Now, nearly a year and a half later, GoPro has released new footage of the daring jump, including a heart-pumping sequence in which Baumgartner enters an uncontrolled spin and nearly blacks out while falling faster than 800 miles per hour. Sheesh. “I wish you could see what I can see,” Baumgartner says in the video, just before he steps into the void. “Sometimes, you have to be up really high to understand how small you are.” -Huffingtonpost"}
