Mycophenolate is prescribed after a kidney transplant. It is absolutely necessary to maintain the health of a patient who has undergone a transplant. Following an inquiry made by News 1st, the Pharmaceutical Society of Sri Lanka stated that there is a shortage of  Mycophenolate island wide. President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Sri Lanka, Priyankara Perera noted that they had to place an immediate order and import a stock of Mycophenolate. He added that the stock is being distributed to all the hospitals that facing a shortage adding that could meet the requirements by next week. But there is a reasonable doubt whether the stock of Mycophenolate imported would be sufficient to cover all the kidney patients or not.
