Today, August 1,  the Consultation Task Force on Mechanisms for Reconciliation (CTFMR) held a session in Kilinochchi to find out what the public think of the reconciliation mechanisms. The dialogue was held at the Pachchilaipalli Divisional Secretariat, Kilinochchi with the participation of the CTFMR Secretary, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu. Residents in areas that come under the purview of the Pachchilaipalli Divisional Secretariat in Kilinochchi were present for the dialogue. “If reconciliation is to take place in the country, all communities in the country should be given equal rights”, said a resident in the area. He also pointed out the immediate measures which were taken following the recent explosion in the southern part of the country (Salawa Army Base explosion) and noted that there is no progress there, though the war ended nearly seven years ago”. As part of the reconciliation process, lands of the people which are being held by the armed forces should be released and given back to the people”, he added."}
