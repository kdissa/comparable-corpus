Real Madrid forward Ronaldo has won the award for the past two years following Messi’s four-in-a-row, while Neymar has never won the award during his career. 30-year-old Ronaldo also won the award for his performances in 2008 during his spell with Manchester United, but a move to Real in 2009 failed to produce immediate results as Messi and Barcelona dominated European football. Messi meanwhile is the bookmakers’ favourite to win the award after leading the Catalan side to a brilliant treble last season, with Luis Enrique’s side winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. Messi has scored 44 goals in 54 matches, while Neymar has found the net 42 times in the same number of matches, and in total Ronaldo has the best games-per-goal ratio with his 1.06 just beating Messi’s 1.22 and Neymar’s 1.28."}
