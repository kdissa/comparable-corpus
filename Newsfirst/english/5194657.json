The Qatari-mediated deal also secured freedom for a jailed ex-wife of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Nusra Front seized the Lebanese during an attack on the border town of Arsal mounted together with the Islamic State jihadist group which is still believed to be holding nine soldiers captured in the incursion. TV footage from the border area between Lebanon and Syria showed the Lebanese captives in vehicles accompanied by masked men armed with assault rifles and waving the Nusra Front flag before they were released to the Red Cross. Thirteen Islamists in Lebanese jails, including Saja al-Dulaimi, the ex-wife of Baghdadi, were also released. Dulaimi, fully veiled, was shown in live TV footage from the area with her three children who were with her in prison. Nusra Front fighters were shown kissing and hugging the sons of Dulaimi, who were arrested by  Lebanese authorities a year ago. Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said her wish was to return to Beirut and then to leave to Turkey."}
