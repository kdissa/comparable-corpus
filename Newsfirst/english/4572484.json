In the statement, the minister noted, “there is also an abundance of gossip about the delegation and undignified attacks against devoted public servants.” He noted contrary to what is circulated, there were no plans to send anyone originally for the 40th session as the Sri Lankan Ambassador to the UN in Geneva is a competent, experienced and respected diplomat. He went on to note that unlike some others who held this post before, the existing Ambassador’s conduct is completely apolitical and had no hidden agendas to embarrass the government or Sri Lanka itself. Furthermore, on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka, the minister extended an apology to High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet, who he refers as a true friend of the Sri Lankan people, a champion of the Global South, and herself a survivor of the horrors of torture. He concluded with “High Commissioner Bachelet, you did not deserve the misrepresentation of your statements.”"}
