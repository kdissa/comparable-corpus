Saudi Arabia is set to build the world’s tallest building after securing $2.2 billion in financing to complete the massive Jeddah City development and the 200-floor Jeddah Tower. The tower has already been built up to the 26th floor. When completed, it will reach one kilometer into the sky and will overtake Dubai’s iconic Burj Khalifa as the world’s tallest building. The tower was designed by Adrian Smith+Gordon Gill Architecture, the Chicago firm that designed Burj Khalifa. It will cost $1.2 billion to build. CNN reports that a Saudi government press release on Sunday said Jeddah Economic Company and Saudi Arabia’s Alinma Investment had signed a financing deal for 8.4 billion Saudi riyals (or $2.2 billion) to build Jeddah City, including the sky-piercing tower."}
