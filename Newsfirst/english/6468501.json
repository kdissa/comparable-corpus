But it was once again Kusal Mendis who did the talking with his bat.The batsman scored a responsible fifty but was undone by Mitchell Starc. On the other side Kusal Perera and skipper Angelo Mathews were the pick of the batsmen. However, the hosts were bundled out for 281 in the first innings at Galle. In reply, Australia were not able to prevent their misery as opener Joe Burns tasted his own medicine.His stay at the crease didn’t last long as the right-hand Australian was trapped by debutant Vishwa Fernando to give a straight forward catch to Perera at mid-wicket. David Warner was undone by Dilruwan Perera and the stumps was called as soon as the wicket fell.Australia ended first day of the second match at 54/2 and trail Sri Lanka by 227 runs."}
