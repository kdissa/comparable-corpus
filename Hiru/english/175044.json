The move could spell the end to the US immigration hopes of millions of people around the world who have tried to win US residence permits through the programme since it was created 27 years ago. “I am starting the process of terminating the diversity lottery programme,” Trump angrily told reporters. “We have to do what's right to protect our citizens,” he said. “We will get rid of this lottery programme as soon as possible.” The programme awards US permanent resident visas to around 50,000 applicants from around the world each year, opening the door as well for members of their broader families to follow them, so-called chain migration."}
