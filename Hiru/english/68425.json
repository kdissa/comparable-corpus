The swearing in got somewhat delayed due to President Mahinda Rajapaksa having gone to the US for participating in the UN General Assembly session. The delegation including the President returned to the island this dawn. Accordingly the swearing in by the new Chief Ministers will take place tomorrow . MeanwhileÂ C. V. Vigneshwaran yesterday obtained his letter of appointment as Northern Province Chief Minister. That was from the hands of Northern Province Governor G. L. Chandrasiri. However the TNA has so far not revealed the mode of oath taking by the new Northern Province Chief Minister. TNA leader MP R. Sambandan told our news team that the final decision with regard to it would be taken today."}
