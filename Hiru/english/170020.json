This area has been considered as an area which belongs to the Deegavapi Temple. The area is also considered as an archeological site.Â A year ago, permission was given to construct a rest house for visiting pilgrims. Today (02) a group of Buddhist monks from the Ampara area has visited this land to clear it to start the construction work. Then a group of police officers arrived here and told them to stop the work saying that they have a court notice. Several Eastern Province Ministers also visited the site and urged the police to stop the construction work. Thereafter, the Buddhist monks agreed to stop it after having a discussion with the police team."}
