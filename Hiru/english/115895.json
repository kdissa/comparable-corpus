They say labour law reforms planned by Modi's government will put jobs at risk that would make it easier to lay off workers and shut down unproductive factories. All India Trade Union Congress secretary said the response had been \"magnificent\" and estimated over 150 million workers participated in the strike, although this could not be independently confirmed."}
