Abdul Waheed, custodian of the Ali Muhammad Gujjar shrine, drugged the devotees before beating them with sticks and stabbing them to death late on Saturday. He then handed himself over to authorities. The incident occurred in the small village of Chak 95, just outside the city of Sarghoda located about 160km west of Lahore. Local police officer Shaukat Mansoor said that Waheed drugged everyone who was at the shrine adding that Waheed appeared to suffer from mental instability. Initial reports indicated there were no survivors from the attack but local police officials later said at least two people are being treated at a local hospital."}
