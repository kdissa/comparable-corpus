The CEB earlier decided to implement the new tariffs with effect from April 20 under the recommendations given by the Public Utilities Commission. But President Mahinda Rajapaksa addressing the UPFA May Day rally in Colombo said yesterday that no tariffs would be hiked for the consumers using upto 60 units and concessions would be granted to others using upto 180 units. However Opposition political parties staged various protests against the revised electricity tariffs in and out of parliament during the last few days.
