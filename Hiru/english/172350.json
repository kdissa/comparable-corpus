'More than 70% of the civilians were killed in the regime and Russian air strikes, or in air raids of the international coalition’ fighting the Islamic State group, the Britain-based monitor's head Rami Abdel Rahman said. Backed by Russian air strikes, the forces of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad are pressing a battle to retake IS-controlled areas in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. A US-led international coalition has been providing air support to a Kurdish-Arab alliance also fighting the jihadists in its former northern bastion of Raqa city and Deir Ezzor. It said 738 jihadists from IS and a group led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria affiliate also died. Syria's conflict has killed more than 330,000 people and displaced millions since it broke out in 2011."}
