President Maithripala Sirisena has proposed to affiliate it to a state university. However, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has argued that if it is taken over by the government, such a step would give negative precedence for future foreign investors. At that juncture, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has objected to the Prime Minister. Minister Ranawaka who expressed his views to our news team said that the Presidentâ€™s proposal is appropriate and, it should be put under the Higher Education Ministry. In addition, the Cabinet has argued the implementation of the death penalty against drug convicts. When Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera posed his objections against the decision, the President has told that the judges have passed the death sentence and, he wants only to implement it. At the same time, minister Samaraweera said that he wants to import cigarettes from China to discourage smuggling cigarettes to the country. Answering Samaraweera, Health minister Rajitha Senarathna stated that it is disputable for a government which used anti-smoking, a slogan in its election campaign and now attempts to import cigarettes. He proposed the Finance minister to use scanners to nab smugglers at the airport instead."}
