Although the Ministry of Education had earlier released a circular stating that the number of students enrolled to a grade one classroom would be 35, but during the recent days another circular was released increasing it to 40. However, from next year onwards per year, the number of students per classroom will be reduced by one each, thus reducing the number of students in a classroom to 35 by the year 2021. Meanwhile, General Secretary of the Lanka Teachers Union said that they would take legal action against the decisions taken by the Ministry."}
