Flynn said in a statement that the launch defied a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at keeping Iran from developing nuclear-armed missiles. Flynn, a retired Army general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, delivered his remarks in a surprise appearance at the daily White House press briefing. He cited other examples of what he called Iran's \"destabilizing behavior across the Middle East,\" including reported attacks on U.S. allies by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea."}
