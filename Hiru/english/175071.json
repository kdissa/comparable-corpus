When a petition filed by Kumarasinghe was taken up for hearing before a five-member bench of judges, yesterday, it was decided to announce the verdict today. Supreme Court has ruled that MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is not entitled to hold the post of a Member of Parliament as she had contested the election while holding dual citizenship. The decision of the five-judge bench which included the Chief Justice was announced by a panel of three judges at the Supreme Court this morning (02). The Supreme Court also ordered the Court Registrar to immediately inform the Secretary-General of Parliament of the decision. 6 voters of the Galle district filed a petition in the Court of Appeals requesting the court to declare that Kumarasinghe was ineligible to remain as a parliamentarian while holding a dual citizenship. On 3 rd of May, Court of Appeal ruled that Geetha Kumarasinghe was not entitled to hold the post as she had contested the election in August 2015 while holding a dual citizenship which is against the 19th amendment to the Constitution. Following the Court of Appealâ€™s judgment, on the 9th of May, Geetha Kumarasinghe filed a petition challenging that judgment in the Supreme Court. Later, the Supreme Court allowed former Minister Piyasena Gamage also to intervene in the petition. According to the judgment issued by the Supreme Court today, the MP post held by Geetha Kumarasinghe will become null and void. Therefore, the Galle District MP post will be given to Piyasena Gamage who had obtained 45,245 preferential votes in the 2015 General election, after Geetha Kumarasinghe."}
