Archaeologist Kalum Nalinda Manamendra Arachchi said that these information was uncovered in excavations carried out in Jaffna. Several utensils had been found in a cave close to the shores. Since these were similar to utensils found in Africa, there is belief that such pre historic species had arrived in Sri Lanka."}
