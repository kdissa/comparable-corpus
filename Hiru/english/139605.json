Call them daredevils because this couple tied the knot hanging 90 metres above ground. In Kolhapur in India, exactly this has happened when Zehdir and Reshma married literally \"in the air\".

The Kolhapur bride and the groom - who had met and fallen in love while trekking - hung from a ropeway and went about their nuptials like it was no big deal.
