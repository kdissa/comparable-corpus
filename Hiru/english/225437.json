They came from the Fort Railway Station to the Ministry of Finance in a protest march this afternoon demanding the implementation of the Cabinet Paper, which proposes to provide for a pension or monthly allowance due to the privatization of the state power loom owned by the state textile department. As a result, police took steps to close the entrance to the Galle Face Green at the Lotus roundabout. They had a discussion with a Deputy Secretary to the Treasury and the chairperson of the association H.H. Tilakaratne shared his thoughts with the media."}
