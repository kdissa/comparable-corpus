Meanwhile the All Ceylon Makkal Congress, headed by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is scheduled to meet tomorrow to decide on the party that they will support in the next election. Rishad Bathiudeen made this statement to the media after the Vavuniya District Coordination meeting yesterday. Addressing the media after a function held in Kegalle yesterday, Chairman of the UNP Kabir Hashim said that a UNP candidate who can contest with the opposition parties will be nominated for the next presidential election. Meanwhile, State minister Dilip Vedaarachchi said at a rally in Hambantota yesterday that the presidential candidate should be chosen not by a leadership council but by the majority opinion of the party. Commenting on the appointment of a new leadership council by the UNP, Central province Governor Maithree Gunaratne said in Kandy yesterday that such a leadership council would not resolve the party crisis."}
