The gunman, 26, opened fire at Umpqua Community College on Thursday morning and was killed in a police shootout. The number of casualties is recorded as 10, including the gunman. The killer's motive is not known, although police said they were investigating reports that he had warned of his intentions on social media. Hours after the attack, in which seven were also injured, a visibly frustrated President Barack Obama demanded tighter gun laws, saying prayers are \"no longer enough\"."}
