Expressing his views to our news team GMOA secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said that a discussion had been held with regard to this last night close to an hour with Ministry officials including Minister Rajitha Senaratne. However the GMOA secretary said that today his association and the Ministry authorities would jointly prepare the list again. Government doctors had carried out a token strike from 8 a.m. to 12 noon last Tuesday alleging that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had influenced the preparation of the post-internship doctors’ appointment list. However Dr. Nalinda Herath said that if the Ministry failed to do as agreed, appropriate action would be taken in the future."}
