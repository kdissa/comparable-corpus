She will also meet army Chief Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. Both men have pledged to assist in a smooth transfer of power putting an end to decades of military-backed rule. However, Ms Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from becoming president and the army retains a quarter of seats in the upper and lower houses of parliament. Myanmar's constitution bars anyone with foreign national children from becoming president and Ms Suu Kyi's sons have British passports. However, she has repeatedly said that she will be above the person she nominates for the role. A spokesman for Mr Thein Sein said the discussion with Ms Suu Kyi lasted 45 minutes and focused on how to achieve a peaceful transition of power. She led the National League for Democracy (NLD) to a landslide victory in 8 November polls. Despite hundreds of thousands of people, such as the stateless Muslim Rohingya minority, being denied voting rights, the elections were the most democratic in Myanmar in 25 years. The NLD won about 80% of the seats in parliament, under the country's first-past-the-post, constituency-based electoral system."}
