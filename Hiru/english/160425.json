Several sections of her speech in Villepinte, north of Paris, appear to repeat almost word-for-word comments Fillon made in an address on 15 th April. An official of her National Front party said she had made a \"nod\" to Fillon and it showed she was not sectarian. Le Pen faces centrist Emmanuel Macron in the final round on Sunday. The similarity in the speeches has been pointed out by the Ridicule TV YouTube channel, initially set up by François Fillon's supporters to attack Macron before the first round of voting that saw Mr Fillon eliminated from the contest."}
