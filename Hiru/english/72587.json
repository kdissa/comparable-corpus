There had been a drop in the production of coconut and hence there had been a decline in kernel related productions in the market. The production of mattress fibre, twisted fibre and coconut shell charcoal were recorded as low, compared to last year. CDA expects to reach the export revenue mark of 45 billion rupees by the end of December."}
