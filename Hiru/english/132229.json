There were 891 attacks during the first quarter of 2016 in neighbors Iraq and Syria, more than in any three-month period since the militants’ sweeping advance in mid-2014, IHS said in a new report. Those attacks killed 2,150 people, a 44 percent rise over the previous three months and the highest quarterly toll in nearly a year. The US military estimates ISIS territory in Iraq has shrunk by about 40 percent from its 2014 peak and 20 percent in Syria. Iraq’s military routed the militants from the western city of Ramadi four months ago and then pushed further west towards the Syrian border. The northern offensive has been slower, with army and Sunni Arab tribal forces taking only four villages over the past month south of Mosul. In Syria, government-aligned forces backed by Russian air power have recaptured territory from ISIS, including the ancient city of Palmyra. The group is also under pressure from a separate US-led air campaign in the north and northeast, where Kurdish fighters have advanced."}
