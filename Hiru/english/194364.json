A local company has filed this petition alleging that the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy had decided to award the tender to a higher bidder disregarding a lower bid moved by them. Here, the senior state counsel appearing for the Attorney General requested time to get more information from the defendant in order to make submissions. Considering that request, the three-member Supreme Court bench postponed the case to 11th of July."}
