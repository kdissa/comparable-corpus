JVP MP Vijitha Herath stated that the students should be allowed to sit for the exams as well. A protest was launched yesterday by students attached to the University of Sabaragamuwa demanding claims over their examination rights. According to police a tense situation ensued before the protest was broken up, since the students had been obstructing the Colombo-Badulla main route. According to Acting Police Spokesperson SP Prishantha Jayakodi 12 police officers had been injured while attempting to break up the protest, while 6 students had also been placed under arrest. However when inquired, Minister of Higher Education S.B. Dissanayeke stated that the front line socialist party must be held responsible for the tense situation. We inquired regarding this allegation from the convener of the Front line social party Chameera Koswaththa."}
