Her rival, Bernie Sanders, has clinched his home state of Vermont, as the first \"Super Tuesday\" results come in. For the Republicans, front-runner Donald Trump won Georgia but Vermont and Virginia are too close to call. The New York billionaire, Trump, is expected to win most of the 11 states voting on Super Tuesday. It is the biggest single day for both parties to select their party nominees ahead of the 8 November Presidential Election."}
