Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was the former wife of South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela. The couple - famously pictured hand-in-hand as Mr. Mandela walked free from prison after 27 years - were a symbol of the anti-apartheid struggle for nearly three decades. However, in later years her reputation became tainted legally and politically. Family spokesperson Victor Dlamini said Mrs. Mandela \"succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones\" following a long illness, which had seen her go in and out of the hospitalÂ since the start of the year. Retired archbishop and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu praised her as a \"defining symbol of the struggle against apartheid\". \"Her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to me, and to generations of activists,\" he added."}
