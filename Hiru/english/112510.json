At least 26 people are still missing after the 33-tonne, wooden-hulled Kim Nirvana tipped over in unexplained circumstances about half an hour after setting sail from Ormoc city at midday. Rescuers pulled more than 100 survivors from the sea and continue to scour the waters about a kilometre from the coast where the accident happened. Just a small section of the boat's underbelly, surrounded by rescue boats, was visible above water by late afternoon."}
