The UN and former colonial power the UK both expressed concern about the violence, in which three people were killed after troops opened fire. Parliamentary results gave victory to the ruling Zanu-PF party in the first vote since the removal of former ruler Robert Mugabe. But the opposition says Zanu-PF rigged the election. The result of the presidential election has yet to be declared. The MDC opposition alliance insists its candidate, Nelson Chamisa, beat the incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Zimbabwe's politicians to exercise restraint, while UK foreign office minister Harriett Baldwin said she was \"deeply concerned\" by the violence."}
