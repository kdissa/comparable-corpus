It is reported that the lady doctor who is resident of Talangama, Kalagoda is a mother of two sons aged 7months and 4 year old. Her husband is also a doctor serving in the same hospital. It is further reported that she has written a letter prior to her suicide stating that she could not bear the labor pain anymore. The lady doctor has closed down the house at Kalalgoda and has been living most of the time in her mother’s house at Gampaha with her husband and two sons. The day the incident took place the lady doctor have informed her husband via SMS that she will be going to the Kalalgoda house at around 1.15 pm after work. Since the lady doctor did not return to her mother’s house at Gampaha even after it was quite late in the night, the husband on suspicion had gone to the Kalalgoda house. On entering the room he had noticed his wife has hanged herself on the fan and had informed the neighbors and the police. Kaduwela magistrate has come to the place where the incident took place and has conducted the preliminary inspections. The post-mortem of the suicide lady doctor was to be conducted yesterday (01) at the Colombo judicial medical officers office."}
