Most of the dead appear to have suffocated after the man set fire to casino tables, local media reported. The gunman began by shooting at TV monitors in Resorts World Manila in the early hours of Friday morning sending terrified patrons fleeing. Police said he later killed himself by setting himself on fire. Officials insisted that the incident was a robbery attempt, and was not terror-related despite an apparent claim by the so-called Islamic State group."}
