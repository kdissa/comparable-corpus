The three teenagers -- two Kazakhs and an American -- were fellow students at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's university and appear to have been hastily trying to keep him out of trouble rather than taking part in an organized conspiracy. 2 were accused of conspiring to destroy a laptop and backpack containing fireworks belonging to Tsarnaev, while the American, is charged with making false statements to police."}
