Blizzards and heavy snowfall have closed roads, rail services and schools and forced the cancellations of hundreds of flights. The unusually cold spell is being felt as far south as the Mediterranean. The number of weather-related deaths rose to as many as 55 with 21 victims in Poland, most of them rough sleepers. It triggered a warning from the World Health Organization that the poor, the homeless and migrants would be hardest hit by the big freeze."}
