The moves, which also include a new Minister of Public Safety and Security, were seen as an effort to soothe public anger over the scandal involving Park's friend, Choi Soon-sil, who is in custody and under investigation by prosecutors. The presidential office said it named Yim Jong-yong, the financial services commission chairman, as the new Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. He will replace incumbent minister, Yoo Il-ho, who has been well-regarded by policy makers and market participants in his current role."}
