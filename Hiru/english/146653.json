This is due to the ongoing strike that was lunched by unprotected railway crossing operators demanding a salary increase. Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva said there are a total of 676 such gates across the island and 25 per cent of the operators are on strike. He also said that automatic traffic lights will be set up in 200 of these gates."}
