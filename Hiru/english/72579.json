A number of incidents were reported recently where attempts were made to smuggle gold from Sri Lanka to India with the most recent incident being reported this morning where a Muslim national from Colombo tried to smuggle 4 gold biscuits approximately worth 2 million rupees hidden in his rectum. However, the Customs spokesperson stated that there is an increase in the number of attempts to smuggle gold out of the country compared to last year and that close to 60 such attempts have been reported this year thus far. Close to 20 incidents were reported during the last 5 months where individuals had attempted to smuggle gold hidden in their rectums. The Muslim national arrested this morning had confessed that he had smuggled gold to India several times in this manner prior to his arrest and that the gold were wrapped in tape and carbon paper to avoid detection by the Customs."}
