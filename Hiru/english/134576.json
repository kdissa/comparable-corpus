Egyptian and French investigators have said a French ship picked up signals from deep in the Mediterranean Sea, presumed to be from the flight recorders of the EgyptAir plane that crashed last month. Search teams are working against the clock to recover the two flight recorders that will offer vital clues to the fate of the plane that crashed en route from Paris to Cairo on May 19, killing all 66 people on board. Egypt's Civil Aviation Ministry on Wednesday cited a statement from the committee investigating the crash as saying the vessel Laplace was the one that received the signals. Wednesday's statement said a second ship, John Lethbridge, affiliated with the Mauritius-based Deep Ocean Search firm, would join the search team later this week. France's aviation accident bureau BEA confirmed that the signal had come from one of the recorders, foreign media reports."}
