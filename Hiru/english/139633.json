Saudi Arabia is facing economic crisis after the prices of oil fell in the world market. Consequent to this situation, factories in the country seemed to be closing down gradually thereby denying employment to thousands of expatriates. Working Director of the Foreign Employment Bureau Upul Deshapriya said that there are unemployed Sri Lankans amongst those expatriates. Meanwhile Indian External Minister Sushma Swaraj told parliament that steps will be taken to see 10 thousand such dismissed workers be deported."}
