The election commissioner, in a notice states that he has received complaints on a scheme to send SMS and voice messages to subscribers promoting certain presidential candidates. The Election Commissionerâ€™s notice further states that sending messages to subscribers without their consent is disturbing a free and fair election. Therefore the election commissioner said that it is apt for candidates not to engage in such propaganda. If a candidate is engaged in similar propaganda within 48 hours before the voting starts, it is also a violation of election law. Therefore the election commissioner said that he would take action to inform all mobile service providers to stop facilities to send such messages over their services. Meanwhile Post Master General Rohana Abedeera said that 90% of distributing voting cards has already been completed."}
