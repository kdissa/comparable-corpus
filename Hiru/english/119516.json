The crash killed all 224 people onboard after disaster struck at high altitude, prompting aviation experts to speculate that a sudden mechanical failure or a midair explosion could have been to blame. The remains of victims were to be taken in a motorcade to a crematorium in Saint Petersburg for identification, which began later on Monday, according to Russia’s emergency ministry, which organized the flight. In Egypt, investigators had rushed to the scene of the wreckage after the crash where 163 bodies had been recovered by Sunday afternoon. Some were found several miles away from the twisted and blackened remains of the Airbus A321. Many personal effects were strewn about with the wreckage in the desert."}
