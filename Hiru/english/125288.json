Heather Clark, who donated her son's organs after his death in 2013, visited the Phoenix family of donor recipient Jordan Drake on Friday for an emotional encounter, foreign media reports. Clark shared hugs and tears with Jordan and her mother, Esther Gonzalez, before placing a stethoscope to Jordan's heart and hearing her son's heart beat again. \"It's hard to describe … that she would be so selfless to be able to think of another family while she's going through her grief,\" says Gonzalez, whose daughter spent years in Phoenix Children’s Hospital with a congenital heart defect. \"We're family now, we're friends now, our families are families, and we’ve brought our families together.\" Clark's son Lukas was only seven months when he died with a babysitter, whose boyfriend allegedly abused the child; the matter is under police investigation, Clark says. The California mom quickly donated his organs to three recipients, including Jordan. \"There is another family out there ... and I have the chance to make them not go through what I'm about to go through,\" she said of her decision, reportedly."}
