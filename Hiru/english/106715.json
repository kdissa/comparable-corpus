Meanwhile MEP leader and former Minister Dinesh Gunawardhana says that Buddhism gets sidelined as a result of  the 33rd Clause of the proposed 19th constitutional amendment. Expressing his views to our news team the MEP leader said that in Clause nine of the current constitution there is provision for protecting and nurturing Buddhism. The former Minister said that as a result of the 33th Clause Buddhism becomes subjected to a lessening in importance.

Speaking to our news team the councilor said that Protecting and nurturing Buddhism was not impeded in any way by the 33th Clause."}
