He said moves to negotiate a new \"fair\" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers would begin. Trump said during last year's presidential election campaign that he would take the step to help his country's oil and coal industries. Opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping global temperatures rises \"well below\" 2C (3.6F) and \"endeavour to limit\" them even more, to 1.5C. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up to the deal."}
