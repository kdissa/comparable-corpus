en_209590_0	The “Mawubima Wenuwen Ranawiruwo” organization has launched a Sathyagraha campaign in front of the Fort Railway Station urging the President to pardon war heroes who are serving death sentences.
en_209590_1	The “Mawubima Wenuwen Ranawiruwo” organization commenced the Sathyagraha campaign yesterday urging a presidential pardon for four war heroes who were in active service during the war and were later handed down death sentences.
en_209590_2	Relatives of the said war heroes are also taking part in the campaign.
en_209590_3	Retired Major, Ajith Prasanna expressed these views at the campaign.
en_209590_4	“By the 18th and the 19th of May 2009, we all were exhilarated that we succeeded in eradicating terrorism from this country.
en_209590_5	However, there are 4 war heroes who have been handed down death sentences.
en_209590_6	War hero Sunil Rathnayake is in Welikada Prison and war heroes Priyantha Rajakaruna, Major Dixon Rajamathri and Samantha Pushpakumara are in Pallekale Prison.
en_209590_7	They all have been convicted for committing murder.
en_209590_8	However, 12,000 LTTE suspects were released.
en_209590_9	We do not know how many murders they may have committed.
en_209590_10	They have been handed down death sentences while they were fulfilling their duty to safeguard this country as war heroes.
en_209590_11	For example, former parliamentarian Duminda Silva was handed down a death sentence.
en_209590_12	It is very clear in the verdict that the shooting has not been carried out by the Duminda Silva faction but by the other faction.
en_209590_13	Dumida Silva gets shot, becomes unconscious and gets admitted to hospital.
en_209590_14	He has not ordered anyone to open fire.
en_209590_15	He was shot first but he was handed down a death sentence.
en_209590_16	A situation like this can only be rectified by the President.
en_209590_17	Therefore, we kindly request the President, as we commenced this campaign yesterday, to grant presidential pardon to these four war heroes.
en_209590_18	We will continue this until the Independence Day.
en_209590_19	It will be celebrated with much grandeur at the Galle Face Green.
en_209590_20	However, the four war heroes who fought for this country’s freedom are behind bars.
en_209590_21	You have the powers His Excellency, to grant Presidential Pardon”
