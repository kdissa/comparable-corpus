en_121233_0	Al Qaeda fighters retook on Wednesday two southern Yemeni towns they had briefly occupied four years ago, foreign media reports.
en_121233_1	The militants launched a surprise attack on Zinjibar and Jaar and overcame local forces, then set up checkpoints at the entries to the towns and announced their takeover over loudspeakers after dawn prayers.
en_121233_2	The capture of the towns highlights how al Qaeda has taken advantage of the collapse of central authority in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been embroiled in an eight-month war against Shi'ite Houthis.
en_121233_3	The Houthis captured the capital, Sanaa, and large parts of the country over the past year.
en_121233_4	Jaar and Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan province, are about 50 km (30 miles) east of the main port city of Aden.
en_121233_5	They had fallen previously to militants from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in 2011, who declared them as Islamic emirates.
en_121233_6	At the time, the militants were emboldened by waning government control during Arab Spring protests, which eventually ousted former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
