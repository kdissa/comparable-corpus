en_184962_0	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said that India was not interested in building ports and highway projects in Sri Lanka when it was first offered.
en_184962_1	“We offered India first - port/highways.
en_184962_2	But somehow they were interested in building the port at Hambantota.
en_184962_3	The government did not want it at that time because it was wartime I think,” the former President told reporters here on Wednesday on his return from Tirupathi.
en_184962_4	His response came to a question on increasing interest from China in Sri Lankan projects.
en_184962_5	“What else to do?
en_184962_6	We went to China and when we mentioned about this, they immediately accepted that [proposal].
en_184962_7	In any case, it was only a commercial transaction,” he said, adding that they knew how to pay it back.
en_184962_8	“We knew the importance of Hambantota port.
en_184962_9	When they offered it, what is the main duty of the leader?
en_184962_10	To look after the country.”
en_184962_11	Unfortunately, he said, the current government sold everything.
en_184962_12	“In our policy, there is no privatization and we do not believe in privatization.
en_184962_13	They [present government] sold it for 99 years.”
en_184962_14	Incidentally, the Sri Lankan government handed over the port to Chinese firms on a 99-year lease last year.
en_184962_15	Rajapaksa said that his country had good ties with India.
en_184962_16	“But they [ India] misunderstood us in the past.
en_184962_17	In fact, an Indian Ambassador had told me that India is like a teenage girl because teenage girls often misunderstand.”
en_184962_18	On further prompting, he said it was Nirupama Rao, the former Indian ambassador, who had made the comparison.
en_184962_19	While India’s external policy towards Sri Lanka is good, the former President said that some cases need discussion.
en_184962_20	On the victory that his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna attained in local body elections, Rajapaksa said: “We won by a majority.
en_184962_21	People have given a mandate.
en_184962_22	We had said that this is not a local government election, but a referendum against the national government.
en_184962_23	Within these three years, whatever government has messed up, people showed dissatisfaction with the government.”
