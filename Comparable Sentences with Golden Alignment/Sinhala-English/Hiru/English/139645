en_139645_0	One of the last known groups of woolly mammoths died out because of a lack of drinking water, scientists believe.
en_139645_1	The Ice Age beasts were living on a remote island off the coast of Alaska, and scientists have dated their demise to about 5,600 years ago.
en_139645_2	They believe that a warming climate caused lakes to become shallower, leaving the animals unable to quench their thirst.
en_139645_3	Most of the world's woolly mammoths had died out by about 10,500 years ago.
en_139645_4	Scientists believe that human hunting and environmental changes played a role in their extinction.
en_139645_5	But the group living on St Paul Island, which is located in the Bering Sea, managed to cling on for another 5,000 years.
en_139645_6	This study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that these animals faced a different threat from their mainland cousins.
en_139645_7	As the Earth warmed up after the Ice Age, sea levels rose, causing the mammoths' island home to shrink in size.
en_139645_8	This meant that some lakes were lost to the ocean, and as salt water flowed into the remaining reservoirs, freshwater diminished further.
en_139645_9	The fur-covered giants were forced to share the ever-scarcer watering holes.
en_139645_10	But their over-use also caused a major problem.
en_139645_11	Congregating mammoths Lead author Prof Russell Graham, from Pennsylvania State University, said: "As the other lakes dried up, the animals congregated around the water holes.
en_139645_12	"They were milling around, which would destroy the vegetation - we see this with modern elephants.
en_139645_13	"And this allows for the erosion of sediments to go into the lake, which is creating less and less fresh water.
en_139645_14	"The mammoths were contributing to their own demise."
en_139645_15	He said that if there was not enough rain or melting snow to top the lakes up, the animals may have died very quickly.
en_139645_16	"We do know modern elephants require between 70 and 200 litres of water daily," Prof Graham said.
en_139645_17	"We assume mammoths did the same thing.
en_139645_18	It wouldn't have taken long if the water hole had dried up.
en_139645_19	If it had only dried up for a month, it could have been fatal."
en_139645_20	The researchers say climate change happening today could have a similar impact on small islands, with a threat to freshwater putting both animals and humans at risk.
