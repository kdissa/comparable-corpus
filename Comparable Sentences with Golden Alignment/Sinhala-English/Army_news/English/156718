en_156718_11	(See full speech below) A house-packed gathering of students, teachers and parents witnessed the day’s proceedings.
en_156718_12	Here follows the Commander’s speech; “First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Principal and the Organizing Committee of Colours Awarding Ceremony of Visakha Vidyalaya for inviting me to grace this magnificent event as the Chief Guest.
en_156718_13	I consider this as a special privilege to be here at this glamorous event which has been organized to honour the young Visakhians who exhibited outstanding talents in the field of sports.
en_156718_14	When I was invited to attend today’s event as the Chief Guest, I went through a series of fond memories I experienced as a student of Ananda College and the many happy hours I spent in the sports field engaging in various sports.
en_156718_15	I am pleased to say that my mother, my grandmother and my three sisters are also proud products of Visakha Vidyalaya.
en_156718_16	One of my sisters was also an outstanding sportswoman and I have visited this top-ranking girls’ school several times to witness her achievements.
en_156718_17	I could still remember the houses the school had during that time; Dawes, Dias, Motwani, Pulimood, Jayatilaka and Weerasooriya.
en_156718_18	Therefore, this opportunity is not an unfamiliar moment for me to be here at Visakha Vidyalaya.
en_156718_19	I am very proud to say that Visakhians have conquered every spectrum in many fields worldwide and it has become a usual thing to witness a Visakhian behind every glory.
en_156718_20	Visakhiyans have always been in the fore-front of the Sri Lankan sporting arena.
en_156718_21	Over the years young Visakhiyans have brought glory to your beloved alma mater by winning many Championships in various sports such as Badminton, Chess, Swimming, Table tennis, etc. Furthermore, they have gone on to reach top levels in both National and International events, bringing recognition to the country as well.
en_156718_22	Young Ladies, let me give you an advice.
en_156718_23	Life is a series of wins and losses.
en_156718_24	Sports teach people the art of becoming a gracious winner and loser, and how to handle either circumstances.
en_156718_25	People also learn to set goals.
en_156718_26	Some of you have won.
en_156718_27	Some came close to winning but came off second best, or third.
en_156718_28	Some did not win any medals.
en_156718_29	But don’t forget that each and every one of you is a winner, even those who can only claim that they only took part in a race.
en_156718_30	I wish to give you a short lesson highlighting the importance of participation.
en_156718_31	Some of you may already have heard about this story from our sports history.
en_156718_32	But I thought of sharing this with you again since this is a significant achievement of the Army history.
en_156718_33	10,000 meter race in Tokyo Olympics in 1964 became a historical event to all of us.
en_156718_34	That is not because any Sri Lankan won a gold medal but because of quality of sportsmanship demonstrated by our Athlete R. J. K. M Karunananda.
en_156718_35	In that event, the one who finished first took the gold medal, after five laps all athletes gave up but not our athlete Karu because he had sportsmanship all over him.
en_156718_36	He finished the event.
en_156718_37	The whole stadium gave him a standing ovation, which even the gold medallist did not receive.
en_156718_38	That was in recognition of his courage and sportsmanship.
en_156718_39	That example he sets that day was included even in the text books of Japanese Schools.
en_156718_40	It should be emphasized that Karu was a legendry athlete and a dedicated soldier who belonged to Corps of Engineers of the Sri Lanka Army.
en_156718_41	Determination, integrity, courage and self confidence are some of the many qualities we can learn from his character.
en_156718_42	The Sri Lanka Army and also the country still admire him for his courage and persistence.
en_156718_43	So my dear daughters, I believe that determination and unshaken courage and other qualities you develop in the field serve as a jewel to you at the time of you are facing challenges and taking on responsibility.
en_156718_44	You must always keep in mind that there are four pillars on which your life is being build: •First one is the one you inherit from your parents and develop at home. •Second is the thing you develop in the class room – the education. •Third is your spiritual and other values you get from your religion. •All those three pillars cannot stand tall if the forth is not them.
en_156718_45	4th pillar is the extra-curricular activities you are doing.
en_156718_46	This pillar will develop your management and leadership qualities.
en_156718_47	The opportunities I gained as an Anandian could be said to be the first step in my leadership ladder.
en_156718_48	The world you would be facing after school life is quite different to the atmosphere you enjoy currently at school.
en_156718_49	As the competition amongst organizations especially the corporate world is so high, their staff recruitment process is very well crafted to screen and select the very best.
en_156718_50	Educational or professional qualifications are only one factor they look into.
en_156718_51	How you fit into the team is what is emphasized.
en_156718_52	I must say that the field of sports is a great leveller where everyone is judged on nothing but performances.
en_156718_53	Exceptional performances could be achieved only through dedication, commitment and rigours hours of hard training.
en_156718_54	The crest that is pinned closer to your heart today is the reflection of your College, Visakha Vidyalaya.
en_156718_55	This country needs more young ladies of your caliber now, more than ever.
en_156718_56	I am a person who had the same experience when I was awarded the Ananda colours.
en_156718_57	So I know its symbolic value to your future, your career and to the rest of your life.
en_156718_58	Dear colour recipients, you have made the Visakhian flag flying high in the sports arena with your exceptional achievements and you have set an example for your subordinates.
en_156718_59	So that you have to maintain high degree of character as young Visakhians as well as sports girls.
en_156718_60	Especially, I would like to advice to you to bring more and more glory to your alma mater without expecting anything as a repayment for your achievements.
en_156718_61	At this special moment, I would like to express my heartiest gratitude to the principal, teachers, sports coaches, and parents for their support and collective efforts towards the development of the skills of these young girls.
en_156718_62	Whatever these students have achieved so far would never have been possible without your continuous support.
en_156718_63	Finally, I would like to extend my warmest congratulation to you and those who were behind in making you, and look forward to the achievements being carried further to bring greater glory to your Alma Mater and the motherland”.
