en_330717_1	“RSMs should be proud to be members in an organization which has gained recognition and admiration of the Nation as those who have won a decisive battle on behalf of the country.
en_330717_2	It is your responsibility to look after your subordinates well and closely.
en_330717_3	Interview them, solve their problems and issues, if any and interact with them and understand their ways of thinking and working while identifying their inherent talents that can be tapped for the best interest of the organization,” underlined the Commander.
en_330717_4	“You all, being the best communicators should communicate well with your soldiers all the time because our organization is a unique one, admired and respected by all Sri Lankans,” the Commander quipped.
en_330717_5	Setting out his great breadth of vision for the organization, Lieutenant General Silva attributed the Modernization of the organization, National Security, Nation-Building, Reconciliation Process, Improvement of Skilled Professionalism and Career Progression, Welfare of Army members & Families, Retirement and Transition prospects for Army personnel to seven pillars of strength for the future as his priorities.
en_330717_6	“In my belief, there are four major areas of focus.
en_330717_7	I concentrate firstly on protection of the country.
en_330717_8	Secondly, to protect the great people of this country who have a remarkable documented history of thousands of years.
en_330717_9	Thirdly, the development of the Army to match with today’s status and as well as for the future, is another priority.
en_330717_10	And fourthly looking after the well-being of all members of this organization is of paramount importance to me as the Commander.
en_330717_11	During my command while focusing on above-mentioned four pillars, my strategy to develop the Army would be implemented under three consecutive stages.
en_330717_12	They will be achieved through short, medium and long term plans,” the Commander specified addressing the RSMs.
en_330717_13	“On our way to success, there are some priorities that we need to address.
en_330717_14	Our utmost priority is on National Security.
en_330717_15	Our approach to ensure National Security should be highly comprehensive.
en_330717_16	It is obvious that we have to face unconventional and unpredictable threats in the future more than conventional threats.
en_330717_17	We also have to enhance our combat efficiency by giving focus to develop our physical fitness, morale and conceptual awareness.
en_330717_18	RSMs have a bigger responsibility in this regard,” the Commander elaborated.
en_330717_19	In conclusion, the Commander appealed those RSMs to be well-geared to celebrate the forthcoming Army day in a dignified manner as smart men of the Army.
en_330717_20	He also requested them to be well- prepared to take part in the National Independence Day, early next year.
