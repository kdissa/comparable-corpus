en_486315_3	“Having understood stagnation over the promotion of Officers at length, I personally met His Excellency the President and Secretary Defence to acquaint them on this stagnation of officers which evidently hinder their career progression.
en_486315_4	I am pleased to announce that with the guidance and directions of the Commander- in-Chief and His Excellency the President, I was able to create 207 additional Lieutenant Colonel and above vacancies in the first time of our Army’s history as a precursor to address existing stagnation of promoting officers to the next higher rank,” Lieutenant General Silva remarked.
en_486315_5	“Today, we all are fortunate to have a Commander-in-Chief who has started his career as a Second Lieutenant, like all of us.
en_486315_6	Also, we have Secretary Defence who also started his career as a Second Lieutenant and he himself commanded most of you in the field during the height of the Humanitarian Operation.
en_486315_7	Your Commander-in-Chief and Secretary Defence always feel your pulse more than anybody.
en_486315_8	It did not take hours for me to convince HE the President, who was generous enough to get the Cabinet approval for the numerical cadre within a very short period of time.”
en_486315_9	“Let me begin by congratulating all Senior Officers and Officers on their recent promotions to the respective ranks.
en_486315_10	Your promotion shows that, the Sri Lanka Army believes in your abilities to perform at the next higher grade.
en_486315_11	It is a reward for hard work, dedication, discipline and commitment.
en_486315_12	Your promotion is certainly an achievement, you know it very well that all officers in one Intake will not get the opportunity to be promoted at once.
en_486315_13	Specially, the recently promoted Lieutenant Colonels, Colonels, and Major Generals will bear the testimony for this fact.”
en_486315_14	“Upon assuming my duties as the 23rd Commander of the Army, I clearly explained you that my command is shaped on four major concerns; protection of my country, protection of its people, development of the Army and well-being of All Ranks in the Army.
en_486315_15	Today, I am not going to talk in detail about first three concerns, but I will take the last point; well-being of all ranks in the Army.”
en_486315_16	“Lack of vacancies for most of the senior ranks was a common issue for many years in the recent past.
en_486315_17	The word stagnation was a common speaking word in the Army for last many years.
en_486315_18	Not only for the officers, it was somewhat similar among the Other Ranks for a long period.
en_486315_19	I must also state that, I succeeded in promoting 7262 Other Ranks on the 70th Army Day marking a historical fiat in number of promotions and I am humbly proud over such an endeavor as the incumbent Commander of the Army.”

en_486315_21	Importantly, the vacancies created through supernumerary scheme was effective for limited number of officers within you, and I am certain that, this supernumerary scheme would address the long-waited stagnation in the officer cadre, bringing justice to their meritorious service to the Nation.”
en_486315_22	“With this recent elevation to the next level, you must be very clear that, your new rank not only brought an extra glamour to your uniform, but also an array of additional responsibilities for you to perform with fresh vigour and dedication.

en_486315_31	Be tough when you have to be.
