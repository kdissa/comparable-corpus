en_890392_0	Unlike in the past, every action of the soldiers is done on my authorisation.
en_890392_1	I take full responsibility for the actions of soldiers carrying out my orders, said Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake in an exclusive interview with the Daily News.
en_890392_2	“Today, a soldier makes an arrest on my written order and I give the order on the written order of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS).
en_890392_3	Earlier, that was not the case and when something happened, the soldier was held responsible.
en_890392_4	Today, the soldier does not have to worry because they have a Commander who will take the responsibility for their actions.
en_890392_5	If something goes wrong I will take the responsibility,” the Army Commander said.
en_890392_6	Lt. Gen. Senanayake said it was safe for people to return to their normal routines and for students to go to school.
en_890392_7	He said the Army has taken all necessary measures to ensure the safety of students and the general public.
en_890392_8	He noted that over 85% of the terror network have already been demolished and the intelligence mechanism strengthened.
en_890392_9	About the opening of schools the Commander said, “When the war was raging in the country, children went to school.
en_890392_10	Why not today?
en_890392_11	This is politics.
en_890392_12	Today you have to see how many children are attending tuition classes.
en_890392_13	The same children are going for tuition classes but not to school.
en_890392_14	Something is wrong somewhere or somebody is creating a situation.
en_890392_15	If for the past 30 years no one went to school, we would not have any young doctors in this country and all of us would been wearing shorts and working in the paddy fields.
en_890392_16	We have given the people a negative psychological effect”.
en_890392_17	However, he refused to take responsibility for the lapses which happened earlier.
en_890392_18	“I am talking about after April 21, after I was given the powers.
en_890392_19	So the operations carried out on my directives is my responsibility.
en_890392_20	Be it a failure or success, I will take responsibility.
en_890392_21	I am confident that we can reach normalcy very soon.”
en_890392_22	But unfortunately, he said the country went backwards because of this incident.
en_890392_23	According to the Army Commander, this particular terror group has not been active just from last October.
en_890392_24	“It has been operating for the past many years.
en_890392_25	So, who was handling Law and Order then?
en_890392_26	It was not the same person who is holding that post now.
en_890392_27	So why didn’t they listen to us and take action to bring the intelligence back together?
en_890392_28	The reason that we have been doing so well during the past 20 days is because the strong commitment.
en_890392_29	We don’t want to play a blame game, but when Army personnel were arrested and taken into custody and the Director Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Amal Karunasekara was arrested, when the Chief of Defence Staff was arrested, yes there was some degree of unease within the military organisation.
en_890392_30	That does not mean intelligence was all gone.
en_890392_31	It was only disrupted,” he added.
en_890392_32	Army Commander tells Daily News: ‘Intelligence now interconnected’ ‘Over 85 percent of the terror network demolished, safety assured’ Admitting that there was a huge lapse in intelligence sharing with regard to the recent terror attacks in the country, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said lessons have been learnt from this incident and proper mechanisms have been put in place to ensure such a lapse never happens again.
en_890392_33	In an exclusive interview with the Daily News, Gen. Senanayake said it was safe for people to return to their normal routines and for students to go to school.
en_890392_34	He said the Army has taken all necessary measures to ensure the safety of students and the public.
en_890392_35	He noted that over 85 percent of the terror network has already been arrested and the intelligence mechanism has been strengthened.
en_890392_36	“We are committed to doing our best to restore normalcy as fast as possible.
en_890392_37	So far, our operations have been an immense success in the aftermath of the bombings,” he said.
en_890392_38	Following are excerpts of the interview: Q. Has the overall threat been addressed and has normalcy been restored in the country?
en_890392_39	A. From April 21, no incident has been reported.
en_890392_40	Why?
en_890392_41	Because the Army has succeeded in containing the situation.
en_890392_42	The Army has taken control of the situation.
en_890392_43	However, it is unfortunate that it was only after the terror attacks that the Army had to get involved.
en_890392_44	Even starting from intelligence, the information was given to the Police, but they never shared it with us.
en_890392_45	Had they given us the information on time, things would have turned out differently.
en_890392_46	Now, we have formulated a twofold approach to deal with this situation.
en_890392_47	One is defensive, the other offensive.
en_890392_48	The Army’s defensive approach includes the soldiers on the road, enhanced security for VIPs, temples, churches, mosques and schools, as well as roadblocks and cordon and search operations.
en_890392_49	Our offensive operations for manhunts are carried out by our Special Forces and commandos and the airmobile troops.
en_890392_50	Q. How successful is the operation to arrest the members of this terror group?
en_890392_51	A. Over 85 percent of those in this terror network have been arrested so far by the Army and the Police.
en_890392_52	Of this 85 percent, there are eight who are suicide cadres.
en_890392_53	Six of them are male and two are female.
en_890392_54	That is the success we have already gained.
en_890392_55	Referring to the recent incident in Negombo, it was not a communal incident.
en_890392_56	It was totally a conflict between two drunken parties and it was about to get out of hand and escalate into a communal riot.
en_890392_57	However, it is not like Digana, Aluthgama or Beruwala.
en_890392_58	At least the community has understood, and our endeavour is to ensure that a riot such as 1983 never reoccurs in the country.
en_890392_59	That is why the troops are on the streets round the clock to give people confidence.
en_890392_60	Unfortunately, the public has lost confidence in the people who should be giving them confidence.
en_890392_61	That is why they are looking to the Armed Forces for that assurance of safety.
en_890392_62	Since the Army is the largest of the country’s Armed Forces, people expect a lot from us.
en_890392_63	Q. Emergency has been enforced for one month.
en_890392_64	Is it enough to clean up this terror threat?
en_890392_65	A. Yes, Emergency was brought in for one month until May 21.
en_890392_66	It could be extended or not, but we are not interested in that.
en_890392_67	We are committed to doing our best to restore normalcy as fast as possible.
en_890392_68	So far, our operations have been an immense success in the aftermath of the bombings.
en_890392_69	Q. Intelligence lapses have been blamed as the cause for this incident.
en_890392_70	What exactly happened?
en_890392_71	A. There was a big lapse in terms of intelligence sharing.
en_890392_72	But, after this incident and the subsequent appointment of a new Defence Secretary - Gen. Shantha Kottegoda, the importance of intelligence has been understood.
en_890392_73	He was the former Director Military Intelligence (DMI) and had also worked for the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB) and served as the Army Commander.
en_890392_74	So he well understands the importance of intelligence.
en_890392_75	Gen. Shantha Kottegoda understands the task of the Army and the value of the soldiers far more than any Defence Secretary we have ever had.
en_890392_76	This is also a reason for our successfully apprehending 85 percent of suspects related to the Easter bomb blasts and the new terror threat.
en_890392_77	It is a very timely decision taken by the President to appoint Gen. Kottegoda to this post.
en_890392_78	However, having a popular Army and an ex-Army Commander as the Defence Secretary could be seen by some as a threat, but the President had the courage to do it.
en_890392_79	We are for democracy and we are working with the three Forces’ Commanders and the Chief of Defence Staff under the President, who is the Commander-in-Chief of all three Forces and the Defence Minister and Law and Order Minister.
en_890392_80	Q. Why was the Overall Operations Command set up?
en_890392_81	A. We established the Overall Operations Command (OOC) and divided it into three parts.
en_890392_82	One, the Western Province including the Puttalam District; second, the Eastern Province; and third, the rest of the country.
en_890392_83	The three areas require three different types of operations and the OOC was set up to oversee and coordinate these operations.
en_890392_84	I think this has also contributed to our success in this operation.
en_890392_85	Q. However, the highest ranking military officer in the country, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said in Parliament that the current Defence Secretary is suitable for peace talks and negotiations and not in a situation like this.
en_890392_86	Do you agree?
en_890392_87	A. That is his personal perception and as the Army Commander, I respect him for what he did back then, but not for what he is doing right now.
en_890392_88	More than a Field Marshal, today, he is a politician.
en_890392_89	So he does not have any qualification to talk about another senior officer in that sense.
en_890392_90	I do not agree with the way he is acting now.
en_890392_91	If the Army, Navy and Air Force Commanders support the Defence Secretary to coordinate the overall intelligence and operational command, then it is much better than having a civilian who does not understand the military.
en_890392_92	We have a lot of respect for our predecessors, but not in today’s context.
en_890392_93	So I do not agree with him as he is Airing his personal views and he is certainly not the best answer to everything in this country.
en_890392_94	There are many players in any team who can do better.
en_890392_95	Gen. Kottegoda was the Army Commander just before the Field Marshal.
en_890392_96	At that time, peace talks were ongoing and if I was the commander at the time, even I would have had to do the same.
en_890392_97	For the last 20 months, I was leading a peaceful Army, but over the last 20 days, I am leading a combat Army.
en_890392_98	I want to go back to peace.
en_890392_99	Q. The Army has decades of experience in dealing with the LTTE.
en_890392_100	How do you compare the threat then with the current threat?
en_890392_101	A. These are two entirely different streams and both circumstances cannot be put into one basket.
en_890392_102	The LTTE was very clear cut about wanting a separate state in the North and East.
en_890392_103	It had a clear cut operation, clear cut uniform and leader.
en_890392_104	We knew what and who we were fighting against.
en_890392_105	But today, I am facing a challenge of ideology.
en_890392_106	This is an organisation that exhibited three stages of warfare.
en_890392_107	One, radicalisation; two, extreme violence; and three, terrorism.
en_890392_108	All three were shown within just one hour together with a heavy international connection.
en_890392_109	However, we are capable of switching and adapting ourselves to face this threat.
en_890392_110	The same Army that fought for 30 years became a peacekeeping and reconciliation Army for the last 10 years.
en_890392_111	These are the same soldiers.
en_890392_112	Therefore, switching from a peaceful Army to a combat Army is not beyond our ability.
en_890392_113	The major requirement in today’s context is integrated intelligence.
en_890392_114	Trust in the intelligence groups.
en_890392_115	We already have combat efficiency within the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and Special Task Force.
en_890392_116	We have enough strength and commitment to tackle this situation as long as intelligence is available.
en_890392_117	In any peaceful country, intelligence is the key factor.
en_890392_118	However, unfortunately, it was greatly neglected during the past few years.
en_890392_119	Q. Many claim that intelligence was weakened and that is what led to this lapse.
en_890392_120	Do you believe that intelligence was weakened?
en_890392_121	A. When we started combat operations in 1983, we had this issue.
en_890392_122	But, later on, with the DMI and CNI being formed, we got together.
en_890392_123	Remember, that at the latter part of the operations, we went right out to sea and targetted ships.
en_890392_124	It was made possible by the intelligence which drew up the plans for us to get the targets.
en_890392_125	Our long-reach patrols took targets deep in the jungles; that again was due to the intelligence information.
en_890392_126	Q. There is much being spoken about swords these days with loads of swords being recovered during search operations.
en_890392_127	Should we worry?
en_890392_128	A. We were carrying swords for many thousands of years.
en_890392_129	I am not saying that having swords in mosques is okay.
en_890392_130	We had bad experiences in Aluthgama, Beruwela and Digana.
en_890392_131	So, in my view, this may be one of the reasons for them to have these swords.
en_890392_132	They also have a requirement for swords when they cut goats for Ramadan.
en_890392_133	That may be one of the reasons.
en_890392_134	So we need not scare the people over the discovery of swords.
en_890392_135	Q. People are scared to send their children to school in fear of another attack.
en_890392_136	Do you feel it is safe for children to return to school?
en_890392_137	A. When the war was raging in the country, children went to school.
en_890392_138	Why not today?
en_890392_139	This is politics.
en_890392_140	Today, see how many children are attending tuition classes.
en_890392_141	The same children are going for tuition classes, but not to school.
en_890392_142	Something is wrong somewhere or somebody is creating a situation.
en_890392_143	If for the past 30 years no one went to school, we would not have any young doctors in this country and all of us would be wearing shorts and working in the paddy fields.
en_890392_144	The people have been given a negative psychological effect.
en_890392_145	Q. There has been a decision not to show people the swords that are recovered.
en_890392_146	Why?
en_890392_147	A. I am responsible for that.
en_890392_148	I made that request to the authorities.
en_890392_149	I said do not allow anyone to act.
en_890392_150	Recently, I saw a police officer who had found a 12 bore cartridge and together with three other policemen, he is showing it off to the world as if he has found 10 RPGs.
en_890392_151	If you go to Angunukolapelessa or Dambana where the Veddahs live, you will find many cartridges.
en_890392_152	If we cordon and search even Sinhala areas, we will be able to find many swords, guns and various other weapons.
en_890392_153	But since we are now concentrating on only Muslim-dominated areas, this has become an issue.
en_890392_154	This is very unfortunate.
en_890392_155	I believe that people should not get scared and should return to work and school and get back to their normal lives and leave the security to us.
en_890392_156	Q. The Army has a special unit called the Cyber-crimes Unit.
en_890392_157	Can they not assist in controlling the spread of hate speech and false information instead of blocking social media which is pointless, as there are ways to bypass that blockage?
en_890392_158	A. That is one major area where we are lagging behind.
en_890392_159	People have no one else to look upon, so they turn to the Armed Forces or the Defence Ministry.
en_890392_160	This is where the problem lies.
en_890392_161	We have to have a national plan - immediate, intermediate and long-term.
en_890392_162	The Army comes in only at the last moment.
en_890392_163	The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) has a major role to play.
en_890392_164	Are they doing it?
en_890392_165	I do not think so.
en_890392_166	This is the time they should take advantage of the situation and impose all the regulations.
en_890392_167	Just blocking Facebook is not the only answer.
en_890392_168	Misinformation is the biggest problem in this country.
en_890392_169	There is too much freedom in that sense.
en_890392_170	If you go to China, do you find all that?
en_890392_171	The people are educated and they make themselves useful.
en_890392_172	Here, these people have nothing to do, so they engage in spreading such false information and create problems for the country.
en_890392_173	For instance, if you take the Negombo incident, it was hardly an issue, but the panic created made it look like a huge issue.
en_890392_174	Similarly, there are rumours about an attack today (13).
en_890392_175	This is all misinterpretation.
en_890392_176	But, as the Army Commander, I cannot rule out any ‘lone wolf’ story.
en_890392_177	So we are ready, but what I am trying to highlight is the panic and fear that is unnecessarily caused by these rumours.
en_890392_178	Q. As the Army Commander, are you happy with the manner in which the politicians are acting when the country is in a crisis?
en_890392_179	A. Even the Parliamentary group has a responsibility rather than only focusing on party politics and calling for a change of government or an election.
en_890392_180	Prior to an election, we have to bring the country’s situation back to normalcy.
en_890392_181	Hence, we are asking them to understand the importance of the public and not themselves.
en_890392_182	We have made our national plan and we have made a request to either speak in parliament or to the parliamentary group because all changes must start from there, with the politicians.
en_890392_183	We have made clear our plan.
en_890392_184	There are more than 500 madrasas in the country while only 300 are registered.
en_890392_185	Of that, 50 belong to the Thawheed Jamath.
en_890392_186	So there is something wrong somewhere.
en_890392_187	These institutions are religious schools so we should know what they are doing.
en_890392_188	When children go to Christian or Buddhist Sunday schools, they teach yoga, but not karate.
en_890392_189	These establishments should be scrutinised and brought under one regulation.
en_890392_190	I hope the government will understand that to preserve democracy one needs to have strong Armed Forces.
en_890392_191	Too much democracy anywhere in the world has also failed.
