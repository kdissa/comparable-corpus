en_389897_10	This young soldier on that fateful day lobbed a grenade against the LTTE’s explosive-laden bulldozer which was attempting to ram the Elephant Pass Army Camp and bravely foiled the enemy’s attempt of entering into the camp.
en_389897_11	He blew up a grenade and laid his life preventing the LTTE attempt of forceful entry.In recognition of this act of supreme gallantry, late Corporal Kularatne was posthumously awarded the supreme decoration a soldier could earn, the Parama Weera Vibhushana (PWV) Medal.
en_389897_12	In 1990s, the Elephant Pass camp remained an important target for LTTE terrorists and a strategically sensitive area for control of the Jaffna peninsula.
en_389897_13	On that decisive night, over 5,000 LTTE terrorists surrounded the 600-strong Army garrison at Elephant Pass and were trying to take control of the camp by forcefully entering into it.
en_389897_14	As dusk fell, terrorists tried a new tactic, sending an armoured fighting vehicle, a converted Caterpillar bulldozer, to break the defence line.
en_389897_15	Heavy weapons mounted on the bulldozer hammered the defenders and LTTE terrorists slowly moved up along their demarcated path, smashing a bunker, and finally the bulldozer broke through the forward defence line.
en_389897_16	Hasalaka Gamini amidst heavy crossfires between the next line of defence and attacking Tigers kept on running until he reached the rear side of the oncoming armoured bulldozer and scaled its ladder.
en_389897_17	Hauling himself onto the armoured bulldozer, Corporal Kularatne used his grenades to kill the four-man crew inside, blowing up with inevitable explosions.
en_389897_18	Thus, the passage of the LTTE bulldozer further was abruptly stalled.
en_389897_19	Late Corporal Kularatne was found dead on the road by his comrades later on as the dawn fell after the fighting.
