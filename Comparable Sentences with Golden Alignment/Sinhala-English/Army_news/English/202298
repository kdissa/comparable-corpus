en_202298_1	Here follows the full interview: Sri Lanka’s Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said the threat of more Islamist militant attacks had been contained and the security services had dismantled most of the network linked to the Easter Sunday bombings.
en_202298_2	Senanayake told Reuters on Friday that investigators had established that the plotters had links to Islamic State, but said the authorities were still trying to establish how deep those contacts were.
en_202298_3	“Up to now the investigations do not go beyond many areas, so we don’t have to worry about the situation; it is controllable, it is contained,” he said.
en_202298_4	“We are quietly confident that normalcy is brought back without” any second round of militant attacks.
en_202298_5	The attacks in churches and hotels across the Indian Ocean island on April 21 killed more than 250 people, including 42 foreign nationals.
en_202298_6	Sri Lankan authorities have said the bombings were believed to have been carried out by two little-known domestic Islamist groups, the National Tawheed Jamaath (NTJ) and Jamathei Millathu Ibrahim (JMI).
en_202298_7	Islamic State has claimed responsibility.
en_202298_8	“There is a link internationally, so we are working on those lines,” Senanayake said.
en_202298_9	“Definitely there is an IS link.
en_202298_10	That doesn’t mean it was a direct IS hit.
en_202298_11	But we are trying to establish how deep it is in order to plan our (military) operations.”
en_202298_12	OFFSHORE LINKS He said the focus of the probe is on the plotting, funding and planning of the attacks, as well as the precise nature of the offshore links - including whether any of the explosives came from southern India.
en_202298_13	Sri Lanka has been on high alert for any fresh attacks, with security around the country ramped up, including around government buildings, schools and religious places.
en_202298_14	Scores of suspects have been arrested in the past 2-1/2 weeks.
en_202298_15	But the army chief said he wanted the military to head back to their barracks soon.
en_202298_16	Investigators from eight countries, including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Interpol, are helping Sri Lanka with the investigation.
en_202298_17	Senanayake said that India, China, United States, Israel, Australia and the United Arab Emirates were looking to provide high grade military technology, including communication and surveillance equipment, to deal with future threats.
en_202298_18	Authorities suspect Zahran Hashim, a radical local preacher from the east of the country was a ringleader of the bombings.
en_202298_19	Police say eight suicide bombers, including Zahran, were killed in the attacks.
en_202298_20	Senanayake, who led the special forces during the last stages of the separatists war which ended in a crushing defeat of the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, said the investigation suggested that Zahran was responsible for command and control of the bombings.

en_202298_23	However, he said there may be other important players linked to the militant ideology and seeking leadership.
en_202298_24	Senanayake said the bombers had mostly used local explosives but may have also sourced some from southern India, likely Tamil Nadu.
en_202298_25	He said some suspects had gone to India, mainly to Kerala, Bengaluru and Kashmir for training.
en_202298_26	However, investigators were still trying to determine more details around their travel.
