en_400140_10	It should always be protected, the President said that adding that we must allow those who can afford to pay for private education to follow their higher studies in Sri Lanka instead of going abroad.
en_400140_11	President Rajapaksa pointed out that we should do a great deal of work to understand the true potential of our education system.
en_400140_12	The present education system is an exam-centric one.
en_400140_13	Due to this students’ opportunities for higher learning has been narrowed considerably.
en_400140_14	Irrespective of the skills, aptitudes and knowledge gained by students throughout their primary and secondary education, their future is effectively determined by their exam results, the President said.
en_400140_15	This focus on exams has created parental pressure and social pressure on these children.
en_400140_16	This has resulted in large numbers of children losing out on many opportunities to develop themselves in other ways during one of the most decisive periods in their lives, he added.
en_400140_17	We cannot allow our children to be lost in this education system, the President said that adding that is why we must broaden the opportunities available for further education through both the state education system as well as through the private sector.

en_400140_23	He also stated that such transformative technologies must be adopted at their early stages.
en_400140_24	The President emphasized that in this context, it is important to stress that the lack of Government resources should not be an inhibiting factor in achieving the broadening of tertiary education options.
en_400140_25	If we can increase the availability of high-quality tertiary education providers in the country, we can reverse the ‘brain drain’ as well as we can help to reduce significant outflows of our foreign reserves.
en_400140_26	The President explained the importance of improving the quality of existing vocational education institutes and technical colleges in line with global standards.
