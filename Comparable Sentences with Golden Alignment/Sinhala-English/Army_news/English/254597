en_254597_0	The new Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva during his maiden visit to the Gajaba Regiment (GR) Headquarters at Saliyapura on Saturday (31) spoke out his mind in the formal troop address, in which he paid a glowing tribute to his parents, mentors, pioneering fathers of the GR, veterans, all fallen GR War Heroes, and touchingly saluted the dedication and commitment of all Keterians, who sweated selflessly to elevate the GR to be one of the best and prestigious infantry arms, mustering admiration and respect of all Sri Lankans.
en_254597_1	He also called upon all to provide him with necessary guidance for discharge of his duties as the Commander and vowed to do his maximum for the benefit of the country, the Army and all Sri Lankans.
en_254597_2	In his moving speech, he said; “Today is undoubtedly a historic day not only to me personally but also to the Regiment.
en_254597_3	The day I joined the Regiment as the first 2nd Lieutenant in the Regiment, was special to me as well as to the Regiment.
en_254597_4	Today is also identical to that day because this prestigious Regiment has also now produced its first Commander of the Army.
en_254597_5	Assumption of office as the Commander of the Army is not a personal privilege bestowed upon me but a dignity conferred on the entire Regiment.
en_254597_6	Today’s participation of all those senior veterans and other Officers for this occasion is a matter of pride to me and it amply reminds us of our cherished motto, ‘Unity is Strength’.
en_254597_7	Your presence therefore is acknowledged with gratitude and will be an exemplary act to all those serving.
en_254597_8	In the face of strong compulsions, exerted by some elements who patronize terrorists internationally, HE the President Maithripala Sirisena, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces unswervingly appointed me to serve the public as the Commander of the Army, for which he deserves my respect and deep sense of gratitude.
en_254597_9	Likewise, the exemplary guidance and inspiration, imparted to me by late Major General Vijaya Wimalarathne, the pioneering father of the Gajaba Regiment and also my first Commanding Officer, provided me with a tower of strength enabling me to overcome all challenges in life since the inception of my military career, for which I recall him with deep gratitude and respect.
en_254597_10	Had it not been the sacrifices and invaluable service, rendered by all Officers and Other Ranks who served under me, I would not have been able to reach this mantle of office.
en_254597_11	At this moment, I gratefully acknowledge the able guidance, lent to me by all my Seniors, including my first Officer Commanding, Colonel Niyomal Palipane and all who worked with me while serving in the 8th , 5th and 1st Gajaba Regiment units, Air Mobile Brigade, Commando Brigade, 58 Division and the 53 Division as well.
en_254597_12	It is not an easy task to rise to the office of the Commander of the Army after having joined as a 2nd Lieutenant in an army.
en_254597_13	It is equally an arduous task to survive with injuries since the onset of the war against terrorism while maintaining good and exemplary conduct for future career prospects.
en_254597_14	This commanding appointment, granted by HE the President amidst strong challenges is an appreciative gesture, awarded to all those who contributed actively to ground operations, particularly for the successful conduct of Wanni humanitarian operations, etc. It is my fervent determination to further promote and enhance the infrastructure facilities of our Regiment and make everyone, all War Heroes serving the Regiment happy and pleased.
en_254597_15	Taking the reins in the office of the Commander, I mentioned four major areas of my concern as the future vision.
en_254597_16	That is (a) the country’s security (b) her people’s security (c) improvement of the Army, and fourthly the welfare of the Army community.
en_254597_17	To realize and empower those concerns, I wish to place them on 7 pillars of strength, i. e.
en_254597_18	National Security, Nation-Building and contribution to Reconciliation, Promotion of Army Skills and Professionalism, Career progression of All Ranks, Facilitation of Potential retirees for Productive civil-life, Enhancement of Welfare of All Ranks and Timely Modernization of the Army.
en_254597_19	Through that conceptual vision, I am always eager to provide leadership to the Army, and by working as a collective team, I intend to reap successful harvests of those endeavours,” the Commander of the Army remarked.
