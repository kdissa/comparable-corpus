en_2642061_2	The first page contains a picture of Prabakharan and myself.
en_2642061_3	There were around 1000 books, We are leaving it to the police to find these books.
en_2642061_4	The published books have caused disrepute and I feel this is an attempt to ruin my political career.
en_2642061_5	As an army commander who won the war, I see this as an act which belittles the service he rendered.

en_2642061_9	That is why we believe that the police will take legal action against them.
