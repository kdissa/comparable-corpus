en_4586870_0	COLOMBO (News 1st) – Myanmar has scaled back plans for a Chinese-backed port on its western coast, sharply reducing the cost of the project after concerns it could leave the Southeast Asian nation heavily indebted.
en_4586870_1	A top government official and an advisor told Reuters the initial 7.3 billion US Dollar price tag on the port, set off alarm bells due to reports of troubled Chinese-backed projects in Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
en_4586870_2	The Kyauk Pyu deepwater port is being constructed on the western tip of Myanmar’s conflict-torn Rakhine state.
en_4586870_3	Deputy Finance Minister Set Aung, who was appointed to lead project negotiations in May, told Reuters the “project size has been tremendously scaled down”.
en_4586870_4	The Deputy Minister said the revised cost would be “around 1.3 billion Dollars, something that’s much more plausible for Myanmar’s use”.
en_4586870_5	China’s state-run CITIC Group, the main developer of the project, said negotiations were ongoing and that the 1.3 billion Dollars was to be spent on the “initial phase” of the port, adding the project was divided into four phases.

en_4586870_9	Construction on the port, and an accompanying special economic zone, which together were supposed to cost up to US$10 billion, was expected to start in 2018.
en_4586870_10	But Myanmar officials said the experience of Sri Lanka, where this year the government signed over to China the lease on a strategic port to pay off Chinese-backed loans used to finance it, had raised concerns the country could be walking into a debt trap.
en_4586870_11	The deputy finance minister of Myanmar said his country would give no sovereign guarantees for any loans financing the project.
