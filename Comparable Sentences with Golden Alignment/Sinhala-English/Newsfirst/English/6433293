en_6433293_13	“Today the USD to LKR stands at 155.
en_6433293_14	If the remaining 1.3 billion is taken out, we do not know what will happen to the rupee .

en_6433293_24	What is the result of this?
en_6433293_25	All this is interconnected.
en_6433293_26	Be it the depreciation of the rupee, the reduction in the foreign reserves, or the balance of payment issue or the debt crisis these are all parts of the same stream.
en_6433293_27	These are connected to the trust placed by investors in the country.”
