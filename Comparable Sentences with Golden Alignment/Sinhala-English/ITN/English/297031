en_297031_1	The protests, in which at least 27 have now been killed and over 600 wounded, began over unemployment and poor services but have escalated into calls for a change of government and pose one of the worst security challenges in years.They appear to be independent of any political party and seemingly took the security forces by surprise.At least 4,000 protesters gathered in Baghdadâ€™s Tayaran Square and attempted to march onto the central Tahrir Square only to be met with open fire and heavy tear gas.Police used live ammunition in the Zaafaraniya district of Baghdad, where a protester was shot dead, and there were protests in the northwestern Shula district.
