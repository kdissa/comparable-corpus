en_457533_0	Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has emphasized that the work stoppage launched by the Government Medical Officers Association is unreasonable.
en_457533_1	Patients who arrived at hospitals for treatment had to return back empty handed.
en_457533_2	The patients condemned the strike action of the doctors who are putting their lives in danger on behalf of achieving parochial aims.
en_457533_3	Meanwhile, several doctors who are dedicated to patients were seen serving the patients without joining in the strike.
en_457533_4	Minister Rajitha Senaratne pointed out that the doctors have launched this strike citing causes through the media deceiving the people.
en_457533_5	As one of the reasons they have cited is the increase of the Value Added Tax imposed on the doctors from12 percent to 24 percent.
en_457533_6	But the Health Minister emphasized that the 24 percent VAT is being levied only from doctors who are earning a monthly income of more than 350,000 rupees.
en_457533_7	They claim that the people are burdened with tax following the 15 percent VAT imposed on Private Hospitals.
en_457533_8	However, the Health Minister said that the VAT imposed on Private Hospitals had been completely removed with effect from last month.
en_457533_9	Accordingly, this strike is not a reasonable work stoppage mooted giving consideration to the people.
en_457533_10	The Government has also decided to remove in future the indirect tax effecting the ordinary people.
en_457533_11	Issuing a statement, the Health Minister has underscored that under such circumstances the aim of the Government Medical Officers Association in launching so called strikes is to achieve its narrow political objectives.
en_457533_12	Meanwhile, patients in large numbers who visited hospitals with the intention of seeking treatment had to face grate hardships.
en_457533_13	Also it was witnessed how doctors who did not extend their support for the narrow aims of the Government Medical Officers Association were engaged in their duties caring for the patients.
en_457533_14	Doctors serving at the Maradana Ranasinghe Premadasa Hospital were not engaged in the strike.
en_457533_15	These doctors claimed that it is their responsibility to serve the people as they pursued their studies from public funds.
