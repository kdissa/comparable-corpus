en_802943_12	The President pointed out that various foreign powers were operating against Sri Lanka using new tactics and had resulted in his nationalistic programme being heavily criticized.
en_802943_13	He said though some people were talking about a new Constitution, he had neither received a relevant draftnor had been informed about it and that such moves were only creating unrest among the Buddhist community in the South and deceiving the people in the North.

en_802943_15	The absence of a strong parliament would result in the inability to take decisions needed for the future and destabilize the country.
