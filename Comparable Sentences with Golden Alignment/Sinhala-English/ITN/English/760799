en_760799_1	From incidents that happened in the last few days, it is the view of the majority that the Rajapaksas were exploiting Parliamentarians for their family power struggle.
en_760799_2	The internal dispute of the Joint Opposition has again aggravated, following the statement made to the Sunday Lankadeepa by Parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage representing the Joint Opposition.
en_760799_3	Mahindananda Aluthgamage had told the Sinhala newspaper that Parliamentarian Kumara Welgama is a joker and there is no use in talking about him.
en_760799_4	Kumara Welgama has strongly responded to this statement at a public meeting held in Kalutara.
en_760799_5	In a retaliatory speech, Welgama accused Aluthgamage of being a coward who lacks a backbone as he claimed Aluthgamage failed to take the stage at a JO rally held in Nugegoda.

en_760799_7	He said if needed, he could reveal the names of such persons.
en_760799_8	He said that he wanted none other than Mahinda Rajapaksa.
en_760799_9	Mr. Welgama said that he had been an electoral organizer before Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa was born.
en_760799_10	During this 36 year period he had not made any wrong statement to the people.

en_760799_12	Mr. Welgama had earlier made a statement that the entire country would be shattered if a Hitler returned to power.
en_760799_13	This statement may have caused anger in Mahindananda Aluthgamage who is representing the faction of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa the former Defence Secretary.
en_760799_14	The internal clash of the Joint Opposition between the Gotabhaya faction and the Mahinda faction has aggravated in the face of such disputes.
en_760799_15	Mr. Welgama has further pointed out that there is an issue of the future of the country with the statements made by Vjayakala Maheshwaran that a Prabhakaran is needed for the North while a Hitler is expected for the South.
