en_9306877_0	Colombo (News 1st): Petroleum trade unions have taken steps to suspend the supply of fuel to the Electricity Board from midnight yesterday (June 30).
en_9306877_1	The trade unions have taken this step in protest against Minister Ravi Karunanayake and allegations that the minister was obstructing the process of renovating the supply line from the Colombo Port to Kolonnawa.
en_9306877_2	The 05 kilometre supply pipe network which carries fuel from tankers docked at the Colombo Harbour to Kolonnawa is more than 75 years old.
en_9306877_3	Leaks were reported on this network on a number of occasions and due to corrosion, many pipes were abandoned completely, leaving only two pipelines to be used.
en_9306877_4	Due to its present condition, the supply process of three days now takes around 06 days for fuel to reach Kolonnawa from the Port.
en_9306877_5	This costs the state around US$ 4 million a year as delay charges for tankers.
en_9306877_6	Trade unions claim it is paramount to repair these pipes.
