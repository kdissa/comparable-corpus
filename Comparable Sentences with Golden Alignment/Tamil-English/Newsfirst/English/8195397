en_8195397_0	COLOMBO (News 1st) – Radio New Zealand made a revelation about a Sri Lankan visa scam involving hundreds of students studying in New Zealand.
en_8195397_1	The report says the New Zealand immigration office in Mumbai that handles Sri Lankan applications received a tip-off at the beginning of this year.
en_8195397_2	Officials inquiring into the incident concluded a Sri Lankan based finance company has been fraudulently creating documentation to help students meet the criteria of having $15,000 in the bank.
en_8195397_3	New Zealand Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway said officials did not yet know how many fraudulent applications may have slipped through the net. The Minister said the officials were going through 895 applications that came from Sri Lanka through the Mumbai office, to identify applications containing information from the “fraudulent” finance company.
