en_8441203_0	COLOMBO (News 1st) – The Criminal Investigations Department is investigating a case of gang rape that had occurred in South Korea in 1998.
en_8441203_1	The three accused are Sri Lankan nationals.
en_8441203_2	Investigations have begun based on the information shared by the Korean authorities.
en_8441203_3	The Korean legal system has a statutory limit for the prosecution of any rape cases, thus when the case was taken up 12 years later by the Thegu Courts it was dismissed.
en_8441203_4	Investigations into the incident that occurred 19 years ago, were abandoned halfway due to the lack of evidence to match DNA samples found on the clothes of the rape victim.
en_8441203_5	However, it was in 2010 that the suspects were unveiled when a Sri Lankan had been brought before Thegu courts for harassing an under aged girl.
en_8441203_6	Twelve years after this incident, in 2010 a Sri Lankan individual employed in Korea was arrested over molesting an underaged girl. DNA sample that the Korean authorities had obtained from the suspect, later revealed that it was a match to the DNA found on the clothes of the rape victim in 1998.
