en_189776_1	The decline was mainly witnessed in three-wheelers, dual-purpose vehicles and motor cars, while the registration of buses and goods transport vehicles increased during the year.
en_189776_2	The reduction in motor vehicle registration during the year could be attributed to the reduction in Loan to Value (LTV) ratios for selected vehicles with the aim of reducing motor vehicle imports to the country.
