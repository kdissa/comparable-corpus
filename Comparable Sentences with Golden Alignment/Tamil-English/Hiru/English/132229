en_132229_0	ISIS attacks have increased this year, particularly in Iraq and Syria as the group responds to substantial territorial losses, a US-based analysis firm IHS said on Sunday.
en_132229_1	There were 891 attacks during the first quarter of 2016 in neighbors Iraq and Syria, more than in any three-month period since the militants’ sweeping advance in mid-2014, IHS said in a new report.
en_132229_2	Those attacks killed 2,150 people, a 44 percent rise over the previous three months and the highest quarterly toll in nearly a year.
en_132229_3	The US military estimates ISIS territory in Iraq has shrunk by about 40 percent from its 2014 peak and 20 percent in Syria.
en_132229_4	Iraq’s military routed the militants from the western city of Ramadi four months ago and then pushed further west towards the Syrian border.
en_132229_5	The northern offensive has been slower, with army and Sunni Arab tribal forces taking only four villages over the past month south of Mosul.
en_132229_6	In Syria, government-aligned forces backed by Russian air power have recaptured territory from ISIS, including the ancient city of Palmyra.
en_132229_7	The group is also under pressure from a separate US-led air campaign in the north and northeast, where Kurdish fighters have advanced.
