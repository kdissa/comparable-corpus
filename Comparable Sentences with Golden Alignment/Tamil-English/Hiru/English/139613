en_139613_0	The ever present risk posed by Lithium batteries has surfaced again with a Sydney man suffering severe burns when his iPhone exploded.
en_139613_1	36-year-old Gareth Clear from Bondi fell off his bike on Sunday while mountain biking in Sydney’s northern beaches, and this apparently triggered the explosion, setting his shorts on fire after he hit the ground.
en_139613_2	The phone was in his pocket at the time.
en_139613_3	“It’s a bit random, the thing to be very specific about, the phone did hit the ground, it didn’t just spontaneously combust.
en_139613_4	It was a one in one million chance I hit a part of the phone which pierced the lithium battery and it exploded,” he told media reporters.
en_139613_5	“I’m 36, I’ve had a mobile phone for 18 years of my life and for that thing to explode or short circuit and cause it to temporarily ignite.
en_139613_6	I could see the metal bending and all the lithium leaking out of the bottom end.”
en_139613_7	Apple has not commented on the accident but social media reports that the Cupertino Company is investigating the case.
en_139613_8	There are also reports of iPhones occasionally catching fire.
en_139613_9	In 2014, a 14-year-old schoolgirl in the US was treated for second degree burns when her iPhone 5c caught fire when she sat down.
en_139613_10	9to5Mac reports that a bystander allegedly heard a popping sound when the girl sat down.
en_139613_11	It is believed she may have crushed or punctured the lithium battery when she sat down, causing it to catch fire.
en_139613_12	The following year on Valentine’s Day, a man on Long Island in the US sustained severe burns on his leg from an iPhone 5c.
en_139613_13	Again there was a popping sound which suggests the phone was punctured when he bent over to pick up some keys.
en_139613_14	In the Czech Republic it was reported that the lithium ion batteries in two iPhone 3Gs ballooned up splitting open their casing.
en_139613_15	The batteries reportedly expanded to double their normal size.
en_139613_16	The fact Li-ion batteries can cause fire and explode, albeit only occasionally, has seen airlines stiffen up rules preventing passengers from carrying spare batteries on flights.
en_139613_17	Spare batteries are either banned outright or permitted only in cabin luggage, where they can be monitored.
en_139613_18	Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) lists lithium batteries among dangerous goods.
en_139613_19	Devices with low powered lithium-ion batteries used in watchers, cameras, mobile phones and laptops are recommended as carry-on luggage while medium sized spare batteries from 101 to 160Wh must be carried in hand luggage.
en_139613_20	High-power lithium batteries more than 160Wh are not allowed on aircraft.
en_139613_21	Impacts however are not the only cause of battery fault.
en_139613_22	In the past microscopic metal particles introduced during the assembly process have called lithium ion batteries to short circuit, the precursor to catching fire.
