en_125309_0	The end of Land Rover Defender production was initially scheduled for 2015, but the model got a stay of execution – for about a month.
en_125309_1	Land Rover rolled the very last Defender off production lines on Friday, putting an end to 68 years of Series/Defender production.
en_125309_2	It's not all bad news for Defender lovers, though; Land Rover's celebration of the event includes a new Defender Heritage program and a very thorough tour of great Defenders of the past.
en_125309_3	Plus, a Defender replacement is in the works.
en_125309_4	As Land Rover recounts the tale, it all started with a sketch in the sand.
en_125309_5	Rover engineering director Maurice Wilks scratched a simple, utilitarian vehicle in the sands of Wales' Red Wharf Bay in 1947, and the idea of the Land Rover was born.
en_125309_6	With the backing of Wilks' brother Spencer, Rover's managing director at the time, Rover quickly put the idea in motion as a hard-nosed, go-anywhere agricultural 4x4 inspired by the Willys Jeep.
en_125309_7	The Land Rover Series I debuted at the 1948 Amsterdam Motor Show and began rolling off the lines at Solihull a few months later.
en_125309_8	The new utility vehicle cost £450 (about US$650 by today's exchange rates) and relied on a 50-hp 1.6-liter engine.
en_125309_9	It took the passing of more than 40 years for the original Land Rover to get a proper model name beyond a series number and/or chassis length.
en_125309_10	That name was "Defender," and it emerged in 1990 to add a bit more identity to the simpler "Ninety and One Ten" naming structure that Land Rover implemented after the Series III.
en_125309_11	The Defender was tasked with carrying the rugged DNA of the Series I, II and III forward into the future.
en_125309_12	Twenty-six years after the Defender name was born, the very last of the Defender/Series models – number 2,016,933 – rolled out of Solihull.
en_125309_13	The model is a Defender 90 Heritage Soft Top and will become part of the Jaguar Land Rover Collection.
en_125309_14	Land Rover released a hefty album of heritage photos in honor of the last Defender.
