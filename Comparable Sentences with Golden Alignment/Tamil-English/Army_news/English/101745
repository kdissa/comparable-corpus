en_101745_14	Here follows the full text of the Commander’s speech; “At the outset, I would like to extend my sincere thankfulness to the HEMAS Holdings, MAS Holdings and other contributors of this noble project for inviting me to grace the opening ceremony of the AYATI Centre for children with disabilities as the Chief Guest.
en_101745_15	I consider this event as a significant occasion in my life as I could also be a part of the noble venture of making a difference for disabled children by opening AYATI Centre, only such Centre in Sri Lanka which is fully dedicated to provide necessary assistance for disabled children.
en_101745_16	It is a fact that every one of us should clearly understand that every child is unique with different capacities and needs for their development.So that, physical or mentally challenged children are not a special category but they have special needs which we need to fulfill in order for them to be inclusive in the society.
en_101745_17	In this sense, I am certain that, AYATI Centre, being true to its meaning in Sanskrit, will bring a ray of hope for such children to improve the quality of life and independence.
en_101745_18	Further, their parents will be relieved with a hope for better future for their children with special needs and learning disabilities.
en_101745_19	It is estimated that, approximately 20% of children in Sri Lanka experience some form of physical or mental impairment and this situation has been increasing over the years.
en_101745_20	The issue is that majority of such children are from rural areas and that has become a major concern in the society.
en_101745_21	Usually, such kids are seen as a burden as they require special attention, care and medical assistance, but we should remember that they need our empathy more than our sympathy.
en_101745_22	At this very special moment, let me extend sincere appreciation to HEMAS Holdings, MAS Holdings and the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya for rightly identifying this national plight and initiating to establish a national centre to provide disabled children with multidisciplinary care.
en_101745_23	Efforts you all have taken collaboratively proved that "humanity still prevails" in today’s highly disruptive societies.
en_101745_24	In this process, as ‘Defenders of the Nation’, we also could extend our support towards this most important charity project by undertaking construction work of this noble project.
en_101745_25	Shedding light on the current plight of this national issue, AYATI Centre, National Centre of excellence would ensure equal access to education, healthcare, social participation, and future employment for such children in Sri Lanka.This project addresses a national need with a vision to enable children with disabilities to reach their unique potential.
en_101745_26	Further, this Centre will undoubtedly facilitate a larger community under one roof by providing essential facilities from initial assessment followed by interventional therapy where necessary, along with basic vocational training and life skills.
en_101745_27	Various services available at the Centre like medical assessment, speech and language therapy, audiology and occupational therapy as well as physiotherapy will bring a positive impact on the burning issues of disabled children.
en_101745_28	The centre, being the only one of this nature will also function as a hub to deliver its valued services to the disabled children around the country.
en_101745_29	Further, I strongly believe this facility will become one of the prominent places to conduct collaborative, innovative medical research and development to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities.
en_101745_30	Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to share a statement of Stephen Hawking, one of the most influential scientists of modern times.
en_101745_31	On the first ever World Disability Report in 2011, he had written as, “Disability need not be an obstacle to success” and proved it by living his disabled-life at his best.The statement carries an important message for every one, especially for children with needs.
en_101745_32	Children with special needs also have individual, innate strength, talents through which they can contribute positively to the society.
en_101745_33	To meet this end, these children should be provided opportunities and hope to achieve their maximum potential and be fully integrated into our society.
en_101745_34	Inclusive education is a powerful instrument of shaping such children’s lives to encourage them to initiate upward movement in the social structure.
en_101745_35	Thereby, it helps to bridge the gap between the different sections in the society.
en_101745_36	The education of the disabled children should be an inseparable part of the education system.
en_101745_37	It should be emphasized that disabled children also have something to offer to our society and that they too are a part of our society.
en_101745_38	I am certain that AYATI centre will be a sustainable solution for the matters prevailing in Sri Lanka with regard to disabled children and the centre will ensure a promising future for them.
en_101745_39	Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to appreciate all the endeavours made by the HEMAS Holdings PLC together with the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya by taking the initiative to construct AYATI centre for the benefit of disabled children and I wish you all the very best in all your future endeavours.
en_101745_40	Let’s get together and develop our children who are able to overcome disability and fit into a modern society.
en_101745_41	Thank You!”
