en_490211_0	The Presidential Address to the Nation during the 72nd National Independence Day at Independence Square this morning (4), staged on the theme ‘A Secure Nation-A Prosperous Country’ reflected well on the policy guidelines that have already been laid by his government, encompassing principles of people-friendly governance which would further strengthen inalienable individual rights of the people and national and public security.
en_490211_1	“We will not allow extremist organizations that pave the way for terrorism to further function in the country.
en_490211_2	If due to terrorists, extremists, thieves, thugs, extortionists, women and child abusers, there is impediment to ordinary life of the people, then the people will not be free.
en_490211_3	We have paid special attention to strengthening the National Security and Public Security,” HE the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa underlined in his address.
en_490211_4	“I wish to fully strengthen the freedom of people to think and to write freely.
en_490211_5	It is then that visionaries and quality works of art will be created.
en_490211_6	My government is always ready to tolerate and accommodate opposing views.
en_490211_7	The media has complete freedom today.
en_490211_8	We have ensured that everyone has the right to freely express themselves,” the President added.
en_490211_9	Here follows the full text of his speech: “Sri Lanka is a Unitary State.
en_490211_10	It is a free, sovereign, independent and democratic Republic.
en_490211_11	On this occasion when we celebrate 72 years of Independence after nearly 500 years of imperialist colonial rule, I address you as the Head of the State with a pledge to further strengthen your freedom.
en_490211_12	I pay tribute to all Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Malay and Burgher leaders who dedicated themselves to achieving and ensuring this Independence.
en_490211_13	Every citizen living in Sri Lanka has the right to live freely and securely.
en_490211_14	We will always ensure their right to think freely, hold independent opinions, and express themselves without any hindrance.
en_490211_15	We will always respect the right of any citizen to follow the religion of his or her choice.
en_490211_16	Every citizen has the right of free association and of free assembly.
en_490211_17	We will always defend the right of every Sri Lankan citizen to participate in the political and governance processes through his or her elected representatives.
en_490211_18	We consider all these as rights of human beings that no one can challenge.
en_490211_19	There are several domains that need to be maintained in equilibrium for democracy to function properly.
en_490211_20	Maintaining the balance of power between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary is very important in this regard.
en_490211_21	There needs to be a clear consensus on the responsibilities of the central government and decentralized authorities in the devolution of power.
en_490211_22	The responsibilities of the civilian and military establishments need to be clearly understood, and we must always remember that citizens have individual as well as collective rights.
en_490211_23	Coordination between the State and the public is integral to this.
en_490211_24	Following Independence, every leader who came to power in this Republic was elected through universal franchise.
en_490211_25	As the current Head of the State elected through the popular vote, I am ready to work with the utmost dedication for the betterment of the country and its people during my term of office.
en_490211_26	In a democracy, when the leader is elected following a legitimate process, he becomes the President of all the people of the country.
en_490211_27	During his term of office, he must serve the entire Sri Lankan people.
en_490211_28	He is not bound to serve only the interests of the people who voted for him.
en_490211_29	I have the vision that I must serve as the leader of the country looking after all citizens rather than serve as a political leader concerned only about a particular community.
en_490211_30	As the President today, I represent the entire Sri Lankan nation irrespective of ethnicity, religion, party affiliation or other differences.
en_490211_31	A strong executive, a legislature and an independent judiciary is essential for the well-being and advancement of any democratic society.
en_490211_32	If, for whatever reason, there is a loss of public confidence in any of these key institutions fundamental to the functioning of a country, that can give rise to anarchy within the country.
en_490211_33	Therefore, all such stakeholders must perform their role with the powers they have been granted for the welfare of the country and for protecting the sovereignty of the people with a national vision.
en_490211_34	I am committed to working towards fulfilling the needs of the people of this country.
en_490211_35	That is my responsibility and my duty.
en_490211_36	I do not envisage public officials, lawmakers or the judiciary to impede my implementing this commitment.
en_490211_37	I not only respect your freedom, but I will work towards improving it and guarantee the political and economic freedom in a truly democratic country.
en_490211_38	Some limitations on the freedoms of the people have arisen because of the way public administration has evolved over time.
en_490211_39	Those rules and regulations that have been enacted without adequate study and coordination have led to the public facing considerable harassment and inconvenience.
en_490211_40	This has led to various irregularities and corruption.
en_490211_41	Losses to the public in terms of time, resources and livelihood opportunities are enormous.
en_490211_42	We must re-examine the need to obtain licenses for things that affect the day-to-day lives of the people.
en_490211_43	We must refrain from imposing unnecessary restrictions on the majority of the people; instead we must swiftly enforce the law against the minority who transgress it.
en_490211_44	We must give our people the opportunity and real freedom to live law abiding, disciplined and virtuous lives.
en_490211_45	Outdated laws, regulations, taxes and charges that prevent people from freely undertaking self-employment, traditional industries or businesses need to be revised swiftly.
en_490211_46	We will work towards removing unnecessary restrictions imposed on the public to better ensure their right to live freely.
en_490211_47	Sri Lanka is a country with an ancient history.
en_490211_48	It is a country that has been nurtured by the Buddhist philosophy, and a country that has been a haven for people of all ethnicities and religious beliefs.
en_490211_49	During my term of office, I will guarantee the freedom of all persons to follow the religion of their choice.
en_490211_50	In the Buddhist philosophy, our leaders always have been advised to ensure a lawful, just and fair governance where no citizen is discriminated.
en_490211_51	I am committed to protecting and nurturing the Buddhist philosophy of this country during my tenure.
en_490211_52	The public will only achieve true freedom when social and economic inequalities are minimized.
en_490211_53	All citizens within a Unitary State should have equal rights.
en_490211_54	Even today, there is a large gap between the haves and have nots in our society.
en_490211_55	The facilities that are available in our urban centers are lacking in rural areas.
en_490211_56	Education facilities are not equal in all areas.
en_490211_57	Healthcare facilities are not equally dispersed.
en_490211_58	Job opportunities have not spread to all regions.
en_490211_59	These inequalities are not due to racial or religious reasons.
en_490211_60	These are common problems that the country faces.
en_490211_61	In strengthening the ability for people to live freely, we must first address the economic problems that affect the public.
en_490211_62	That is why the eradication of poverty is a priority of our Government.
en_490211_63	Thirty years of conflict and various other factors have delayed the progress of development in our country.
en_490211_64	We can no longer afford to waste time.
en_490211_65	We will act to accelerate our development activities in line with new trends in the global economy by making appropriate use of our country’s unique geographical location, natural resources and human resources.
en_490211_66	An efficient and corruption- free Public Service is essential for the development of a nation.
en_490211_67	The public administration and governance must function in a proper manner so as to grant people the maximum benefit of their freedom.
en_490211_68	The entire public administration must accept responsibility for this.
en_490211_69	We have paid special attention to strengthening the National Security and Public Security.
en_490211_70	We will not allow extremist organizations that pave the way for terrorism to further function in the country.
en_490211_71	If due to terrorists, extremists, thieves, thugs, extortionists, women and child abusers, there is impediment to ordinary life of the people, then the people will not be free.
en_490211_72	I wish to fully strengthen the freedom of people to think and to write freely.
en_490211_73	It is then that visionaries and quality works of art will be created.
en_490211_74	My government is always ready to tolerate and accommodate opposing views.
en_490211_75	The media has complete freedom today.
en_490211_76	We have ensured that everyone has the right to freely express themselves.
en_490211_77	Parents will not be free until their children are liberated from the drug menace that has spread throughout the country.
en_490211_78	The public will not be free as long as there is corruption in state institutions.
en_490211_79	Therefore, we will strictly enforce the law to eliminate all social hazards that can impact ordinary social life.
en_490211_80	The reforms required to increase the efficiency of the law enforcement agencies in order to accomplish this are already being carried out.
en_490211_81	I wish to fully strengthen the freedom of people to think and to write freely.
en_490211_82	It is then that visionaries and quality works of art will be created.
en_490211_83	My government is always ready to tolerate and accommodate opposing views.
en_490211_84	The media has complete freedom today.
en_490211_85	We have ensured that everyone has the right to freely express themselves.
en_490211_86	Social media can pose new challenges to democracy.
en_490211_87	Spending more time online, often with complete strangers, creates situations where people are misled by false information resulting in their swiftly believing the worst of those who bear different views.
en_490211_88	I request everyone to act in accordance with one’s conscience.
en_490211_89	Always think about the country.
en_490211_90	Think about your fellow citizens.
en_490211_91	Without thinking only about political requirements, think carefully about whether your actions and your words will benefit or harm the country.
en_490211_92	However, if your conscience tells you that the government is moving in the wrong direction, you always have a duty to point this out boldly.
en_490211_93	We must always respect the rule of law.
en_490211_94	The public will get real freedom only when the law is fairly and equally applied.
en_490211_95	My government has taken steps to change the culture of political interference in legal matters.
en_490211_96	We have many challenges ahead of us.
en_490211_97	We need everyone’s support for the efforts taken by the government to overcome them.
en_490211_98	The Policy Statement I placed before you comprises an action plan that will allow us to overcome the challenges before us.
en_490211_99	It is our expectation to create a prosperous nation through this.
en_490211_100	Only the present generation can realize this hope on behalf of future generations.
en_490211_101	I request all Sri Lankans to join with us in accepting this responsibility that history has bestowed upon us.
en_490211_102	I wish you all a prosperous future !”
