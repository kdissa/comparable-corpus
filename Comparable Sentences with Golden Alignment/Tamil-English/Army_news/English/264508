en_264508_1	In many instances, most of those elements operate under the cover or patronage of businessmen, underworld leaders, employers and different other stakeholders and resort to such anti-social acts as per Police reports.
en_264508_2	Furthermore, some of them appear to seek refuge from some politically powerful elements and members of the clergy.
en_264508_3	It is pertinent to remind here that provision of employment or harbouring of those Army absentees or deserters amounts to breach of the countryâ€™s existing law and is an offence punishable in Court (133 of the Penal Code).
en_264508_4	Likewise, respective Police stations as well as Sri Lanka Military Policemen with the assistance of state agencies are continuing operations island-wide to arrest those elements since they have repeatedly failed to receive general amnesties for legal discharge or report back to their relevant Army formations for discharge procedures.
en_264508_5	Sri Lanka Army Headquarters therefore appeals all concerned in earnest to desist from aiding or abetting them, harbouring or using them for any anti-social acts since such misdeeds reflect negatively on the Army image, although the Army could not hold any responsibility for such involvements.
