en_54262_0	Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, Commander of the Army attending the 69th Army anniversary Flag Blessing ceremony at Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya premises this morning (1) in reply to some media queries after the day’s proceeding were over asserted that the Army would be prepared to undertake the task of eradication of drug menace from the country, if powers are granted as the government intends since it is an organization which could effectively perform what has been assigned to it.
en_54262_1	Here are excerpts of the comments he made to Media: “Since ancient times, the Army has embarked on assisting the development of the country.
en_54262_2	Due to prevailing peace prospects, Army troops with the patronage received from the government have begun renovation of 576 tanks of medium and small size in Trincomalee district, 214 tanks in Polonnaruwa district and 1000 tanks in Wellassa region.
en_54262_3	Intending to assist development taking place in the country, officers and other ranks of the Army through funds and machinery made available by the government are currently engaged in this project.”
en_54262_4	Referring to another query over alleged commemoration of so called ‘LTTE martyrs’, the Commander had this to say : “If anyone does things like these, we have to be concerned as a country, but commemoration of war-affected late Tamil civilians is no issue since it is their prerogative.
en_54262_5	However, if the LTTE is commemorated, we need to be cautious and concerned.
en_54262_6	But a programme of that nature which lasts for about one hour or so would in no way pose a threat to the national security concerns.
en_54262_7	That’s not to be interpreted a breakdown of national security as such.
en_54262_8	All three forces are well geared to face any such national security threat at any time, but no such question arises as at present. ”
en_54262_9	In reference to an appeal made by members of the Maha Sangha at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi monastery earlier in the day in relation to possibilities of Army involvement in cracking drug menace, the Commander quipped: “Drug smuggling poses the biggest menace facing this country as at present.
en_54262_10	The Army already playing a role in this regard continues to exchange intelligence with the Police and the Special Task Force.
en_54262_11	We provide information we receive to the Police from both internal and external sources.
en_54262_12	So do the Navy and the Air Force.
en_54262_13	The government expects to transfer legal powers to the Army to curb this as we were told.
en_54262_14	We also hope to eradicate this destructive menace from the country, if such authority is vested in us.
en_54262_15	Drug prevention should be carried out after coordinating all agencies together for creation of a better society.”
en_54262_16	Successful culmination of the war was a joint effort, he went on: “All gathered together and achieved this victory.
en_54262_17	However, the Army is the only organization which kept its word as it was told.
en_54262_18	All three forces and the Police with the public support we finished the war.”
