en_487257_7	Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake in a brief appreciative address to the occasion reminded that the Army has given all possible encouragement and support for promotion of spiritual faiths of all denominations, intending to equally foster post-conflict reconciliation and co-existence moves.
en_487257_8	His full address to the occasion is as follows; Most Reverend Doctor Emmanuel Fernando, Bishop of Mannar, Reverend Father Peppi Sosai, the Administrator of Madu Church, Reverend Fathers, Brothers, Sisters, Commander - Security Force (Wanni), Senior Officers, Officers and devotees, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good Morning, As the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, I consider my visit to the Shrine of Our Lady of Rosary in Madu which is commonly known as Madu Church as a historic event in my life.
en_487257_9	I have served in these areas during different stages in my military career being in various capacities and I have never thought that, I would be fortunate enough to arrive in this holy premises of great spirituality and divinity to attend such a grand religious celebration.
en_487257_10	Therefore, it is a privilege for me to be present at today’s religious observances and I humbly express my sincere thankfulness to Most Reverend Doctor Emmanuel Fernando, Bishop of Mannar and Reverend Father Peppi Sosai, the Administrator of Madu Church for the invitation extended to me.
en_487257_11	It is well known fact that, Madu Church, which is considered as the holiest place of worship for Sri Lankan Catholics, is a landmark of our country.
en_487257_12	The Church is venerated by everyone in the country and holds value as a symbol of unity not just between Tamils and Sinhalese but among the devotees of different religions and communities in this island.
en_487257_13	I am glad that I got this opportunity to attend Madu festival, the annual feast of Our Lady of Madu.
en_487257_14	It is one of the biggest events of Catholics in Sri Lanka, which attracts thousands of devotees from around the country regardless of ethnicity.
en_487257_15	Ladies and Gentlemen, When we speak on the Sri Lankan history, the Armed Forces of Sri Lanka have always been there to protect the religions be it Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism or Islam.
en_487257_16	The Forces have maintained strong connection with the communities to ensure them to follow their religious beliefs without any disturbance.
en_487257_17	Let me provide you an example.
en_487257_18	The Sri Lanka Army is rich with different ethnicities and religions; it is obvious that the majority is Buddhists but we have Catholics, Christians, Hindus and Islamists.
en_487257_19	However, we have preserved their right to practice what they believe in and established Associations for every religion, namely; Army Buddhist Association, Army Christian Association, Army Hindu Association and Army Muslim Association.
en_487257_20	These Associations organize necessary observances with respect to the religious festivals in the country and facilitate Army members to attend the rituals and share their practices with members of other religions.
en_487257_21	As human beings, we should respect everyone irrespective of the religion, caste, race and gender and we should ensure everyone’s rights.
en_487257_22	At present, the Army is taking every effort to promote religious harmony and religious reconciliation in the country.
en_487257_23	We have always extended our helping hand to religious festivals of any religion as the Army sees the importance of such religious activities as valuable opportunities to promote and embrace peace and reconciliation to deliver everlasting peace in our country.
en_487257_24	Further, it is our endeavour to foster civil-military partnership in order to prevent violent extremism and radicalization in the future.
en_487257_25	Today, every community has gathered at this sacred premises as members of one family and strengthened ethnic and religious ties indicating that the religion could unite the people.
en_487257_26	I am personally well aware how badly the annual feast of Madu Church was affected during the conflict period.
en_487257_27	The festival was held in Chillaw then, due to threats from terrorists and the devotees were with fear and distress over unexpected dreadful incidents, which may occur at any time.
en_487257_28	However, today it is with a sense of contentment, I witness you perform religious activities freely with a smile on your face signifying the freedom and tranquillity you enjoy as a nation.
en_487257_29	We are a nation that suffered from brutal terrorism over three decades.
en_487257_30	Members of Sri Lankan Armed Forces selflessly contributed to bring peace and harmony to our motherland by eradicating terrible violence and bloodshed from our soil.
en_487257_31	I am very proud to state that, our country has become a role model to the world as a nation who defeated terrorism on its own soil and this is a great achievement for peace-loving nations.
en_487257_32	With the unprecedented commitment of the armed forces of Sri Lanka, we are enjoying harmony and freedom for ten years.
en_487257_33	The combat soldiers who valiantly fought at the face of enemy have now been employed to expedite national economic development and reconciliation process.
en_487257_34	Unimaginable post-conflict efforts and realistic reconciliation mechanisms implemented by the government have ensured that all citizens of the country live with peace and dignity.
en_487257_35	The 5R concept, which stands for Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, Reintegration, Resettlement and Reconciliation; is one such movement initiated by the government soon after the termination of Humanitarian Operation to strengthen civil-military partnership to get the war affected civilian into their normal lifestyle.
en_487257_36	This venture became successful with the immeasurable contribution of the Army.
en_487257_37	The Army proved its capacity in effectively assisting to all the stages of 5R concept and continues to promote reconciliation among the communities by winning their hearts and minds.
en_487257_38	Through our experiences, the Sri Lanka Army has introduced an engagement and assistance policy and convinced the people that the military is the best partner for sustainable peace and prosperity.
en_487257_39	In light of the present requirements, the Sri Lanka Army has taken an initiative to transform into a capacity-based organization.
en_487257_40	Further, the entire Army is divided into three categories with respect to the assigned roles and tasks.
en_487257_41	According to this concept, 1/3 of the Army is earmarked for Combat Readiness, 1/3 for Nation-Building and the other 1/3 for Administration of the Army.
en_487257_42	Our Army personnel have proven that they belong to a very professional and disciplined Army though there are very few exceptions as same as other renowned Armies in the world.
en_487257_43	I would like to take this opportunity to admire the silent service rendered by the religious leaders; whether it be a Buddhist Monk, a Catholic Priest, a Hindu Swami or an Islamic Moulavi, he has the power and ability in establishing religious harmony and reconciliation in the minds of followers and in the society at large.
en_487257_44	The most important factor to create a resilient society is to promote connectivity among the different religions.
en_487257_45	A society, which appreciates and respects other religions would never stand against another human being.
en_487257_46	Therefore, I believe that, there is a huge national and social responsibility that has to be shouldered by our religious institutions to create opportunities for peace and harmony among different religious groups in the country.
en_487257_47	Being a Buddhist by birth, I am not much qualified to give you teachings on your religion.
en_487257_48	However, I wish to emphasize this message “Love your neighbour as yourself” which is applicable to anyone of us irrespective of our religious belief.
en_487257_49	Let’s respect and be compassionate to everyone alike and make our country prosper with peace and harmony.
en_487257_50	Finally, I once again wish to thank everyone who have bestowed this golden opportunity to me to visit Madu Church.
en_487257_51	May Mother Mary will flourish all her love towards our citizens and ensure peace and harmony forever !
en_487257_52	God Bless You !
en_487257_53	Thank you.
