en_488716_0	The mega exhibition of ‘Bunker Kurutu Gee’ (bunker graffiti), an attempt to showcase creative poetic skills of the soldiers who compiled them while they were serving in bunkers to fight against LTTE terrorists, drew the attention of a large gathering of servicemen, civilians and young men who visited the Defence Services College, Colombo 2 on Saturday (30).
en_488716_1	This attempt, considered as a rare and most deserving, if not a worthy gesture and a tribute to their past memories was staged by the ‘Arrya’ Foundation which claimed this exhibition was one of the world’s firsts since any display of such poems, quatrains and graffiti has never been reported earlier in this way.
