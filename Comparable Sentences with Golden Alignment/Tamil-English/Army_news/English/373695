en_373695_1	‘If the Government as well as the private sector can ensure that a high standard of education is provided by local universities and other higher educational institutions, it may even be possible for us to start attracting international students to study in Sri Lanka and convert the higher education sector into a foreign exchange earner for the country’, the President said.

en_373695_9	The free education system had a truly transformative impact on Sri Lanka.
en_373695_10	It should always be protected, the President said that adding that we must allow those who can afford to pay for private education to follow their higher studies in Sri Lanka instead of going abroad.
en_373695_11	President Rajapaksa pointed out that we should do a great deal of work to understand the true potential of our education system.
en_373695_12	The present education system is an exam-centric one.
en_373695_13	Due to this students’ opportunities for higher learning has been narrowed considerably.
en_373695_14	Irrespective of the skills, aptitudes and knowledge gained by students throughout their primary and secondary education, their future is effectively determined by their exam results, the President said.
en_373695_15	This focus on exams has created parental pressure and social pressure on these children.
en_373695_16	This has resulted in large numbers of children losing out on many opportunities to develop themselves in other ways during one of the most decisive periods in their lives, he added.
en_373695_17	We cannot allow our children to be lost in this education system, the President said that adding that is why we must broaden the opportunities available for further education through both the state education system as well as through the private sector.
en_373695_18	It is critical to increase the intake of students into universities and other tertiary education institutions.
en_373695_19	More investments need to be made to upgrade their infrastructure facilities and increase their human resources, the President said.

en_373695_23	He also stated that such transformative technologies must be adopted at their early stages.
en_373695_24	The President emphasized that in this context, it is important to stress that the lack of Government resources should not be an inhibiting factor in achieving the broadening of tertiary education options.
en_373695_25	If we can increase the availability of high-quality tertiary education providers in the country, we can reverse the ‘brain drain’ as well as we can help to reduce significant outflows of our foreign reserves.
en_373695_26	The President explained the importance of improving the quality of existing vocational education institutes and technical colleges in line with global standards.
en_373695_27	‘As outlined in the “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour” Policy Document, which has now been endorsed as the Policy Document of the Government, we have ambitious plans to effect the reforms that are required in the education sector, from preschool through to the tertiary level’, the President said.
