A year after losing the decider to Bubba Watson, 48th seed Kisner proved too good for Kuchar, never trailing in a scrappy all-American final in which birdies proved elusive at Austin Country Club. Kisner is the first player to win the championship after losing his opening match. He went down to Ian Poulter, but bounced back to beat Tony Finau and Keith Mitchell in the round-robin phase and progress out of his group."}
