Forty-seven people were rescued after the accident near Puerto Lempira, said Jose Domingo Meza. Boats regularly gather off the Honduran coast for lobster-fishing. Another fishing boat capsized earlier in the day in the same region because of the poor weather, but all 49 people onboard were rescued. Honduras lobster exports generated $46 million in 2018 and were sent mostly to the United States."}
