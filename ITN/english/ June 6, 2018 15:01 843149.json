Despite decades of reported tensions, North Korean nuclear and missile tests and a widening economic gap between the two countries, ploughing through the often murky waters that divide them has never been an issue for Li, 69, and his fellow swimmers. Climbing onto North Korean soil, however, has always been forbidden. For Li, it makes sense for North Korea to open up its borders to China, its main trading partner and ally."}
