One of the worst-affected areas is the state of Niger, where at least 40 people have died. Peopleâ€™s homes and farms are all flooded and the only means of navigating through is by boat. The situation has remained for weeks and the water is not receding. This is the result of torrential rains and the release of water from two flooded dams in the state. The floods have resulted in heavy losses for local residents, who mainly make a living on fishing and farming."}
