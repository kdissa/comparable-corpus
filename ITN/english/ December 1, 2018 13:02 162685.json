Video images showed a snow-covered highway that had buckled, with a car sitting between two deep fissures crossing the highway.The 7.0 magnitude earthquake’s epicenter was 13 km north of Anchorage, home to about 40 percent of the state’s population. The temblor had a depth of 43 km. A tsunami warning was issued for Cook Inlet, which links Anchorage with the Gulf of Alaska, but it was later canceled.The quake, of a magnitude that is common in Alaska, was followed by numerous aftershocks, and climatologist Rick Thoman reported that he felt it in Fairbanks, about 350 miles north of Anchorage, a city of about 300,000 residents.Rush-hour traffic in Anchorage came to a standstill and jammed up heading out of town after the quake struck at around 8:30 a.m."}
