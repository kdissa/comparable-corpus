Schools operates as usual", "Time": " July 4, 2018 20:34 ", "Content": "The attempt made by some trade unions in the teaching service to curtail activities in the schools today was futile. No school in the country was kept closed. As all the Schools Island wide were opened, the trade union action was unsuccessful. But some media outlets propagated false reports that schools will be closed today. Minister of Education AkilaVirajKariyawasam emphasized that no school will be closed. Our correspondents reported that teachers and students attended schools as usual. Minister AkilaVirajKariyawasam extended his gratitude to the school principals, teachers and the parents for keeping schools open. Meanwhile, a protest was staged before the Ministry of Education in Pelawatta against the decision of some trade unions to launch a strike. As another group reached the place of protest held, a tense situation was created. A complaint was lodged at the Human Rights Council against the trade unions who made an attempt to violate rights of the school children staging a strike. The complaint was made by the National Education Services Union."}
