Before the start of the recently-concluded Bangladesh ODI series, Sports Minister Harin Fernando wrote a stern letter to Sri Lanka Cricket requesting for a complete overhaul in the national team’s coaching setup. However, with less than two weeks to go for the start of Sri Lanka’s home series against New Zealand, which starts on 14th August with two Test matches in the ICC World Test Championship, SLC has not come into terms with Head Coach Chandika Hathurusingha, who still has around 16 months left in his contract and is not ready to resign from his post. But the information emanating from the field of cricket report that Hathurusinghe will continue his tenure till Sri Lanka Cricket team plays with Newzealand. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket will continue their hunt for a new head coach, which is now set to be completed at the end of the New Zealand series. Dean Jones, Grant Flower, Tom Moody, Russel Domingo and Mickey Arthur are all names being discussed by SLC,"}
