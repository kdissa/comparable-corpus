The era name, or “gengo,” is used widely in Japan on coins, calendars, newspapers and in official paperwork. Following the announcement, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government approved “Reiwa”, the characters from the Manyoshu an ancient collection of Japanese poetry as the best gengo to show hopes for the new era. There have been four era names in Japan’s modern history: Meiji, Taisho, Showa and the current Heisei, meaning “achieving peace.”"}
