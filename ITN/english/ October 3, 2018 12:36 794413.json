The panda triplets, Meng Meng, Shuai Shuai and Ku Ku, were born within four hours of one another on July 29, 2014, in Guangzhou City, capital of south China’s Guangdong Province. They are the longest surviving panda triplets in history. This probably explains the reason why giant panda lovers have chosen Guangzhou Chimelong Safari Park for a special holiday outing. Fluffy and adorably clumsy, the pandas eating bamboo, scratching and fighting with each other amused many visitors, especially kids."}
