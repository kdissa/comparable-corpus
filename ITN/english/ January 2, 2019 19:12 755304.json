A special press conference was held at the Presidential Secretariat in this regard today. The Third DhammaSangayana came up with three baskets,   Vinaya, Sutta and Abhidharma of Buddhist doctrine and Arhat Mahinda brought them to Sri Lanka. The doctrine of the Buddha has been preserved for many centuries in Sri Lanka with state honor. The Maha Sangha including ArihatTheras secured the Buddhist doctrine for many centuries and for the first time in the history it was turned to written form during the reign of Valagamba in the first century BC at the Aluvihara, Matale. In the 2500th Sri SambuddhaJayanthiya, which was marked in 1956, the Tripitaka was printed as a complete series of books. 1500 Maha Sanga will participate in the event."}
