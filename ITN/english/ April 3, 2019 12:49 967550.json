But now the ocean is fighting back. Shellfish, such as lobsters, could offer a solution to the scourge of single-use plastic thanks to a bio-polymer in their shells called chitin. London-based startup The Shellworks is developing a method to transform the chitin from the shells of lobsters and other crustaceans normally destined for the rubbish tip into a novel bioplastic that’s both biodegradable and recyclable. The shells are first pulverised in a blender before being broken down further in various solutions to extract the chitin. One of their experiments includes using a heated mould that’s dipped into the gooey chitin mixture to make plant pots."}
