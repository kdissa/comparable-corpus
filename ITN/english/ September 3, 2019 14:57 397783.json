Occasionally, the bottom of one of the icebergs is dissolved by warming waters, leaving it top-heavy and plunging into a somersault. One of the last playful acts before its eventual death. For the Wahlenberg glacier above the fjord, calving is a natural process, sheering off chunks from the main ice shelf into the water. But it is now happening at an increasing rate because of the rising temperatures in ocean waters, says Kim Holmen, the international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute."}
