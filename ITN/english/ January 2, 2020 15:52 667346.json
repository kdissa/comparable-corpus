Some young refugees staying in small tents were going to train station to go to relatives and friends in Athens due to the cold wave. The big tent nearby was packed with more than 30 smaller tents. The camp is currently home to about 2,500 refugees. Over the past three months, a steady stream of refugees stranded on Greek islands have been transferred to the land, worsening the situation in the already overcrowded camp."}
