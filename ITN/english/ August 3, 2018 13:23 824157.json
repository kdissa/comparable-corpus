Aerial footage showed several fire crews fighting the blaze in a rural area, with 80 structures believed to be threatened. The latest fire comes as Oregonâ€™s southern neighbour, California continues to battle an 11-day-old blaze that has killed at least six people and destroyed over 1,000 homes. The intense wildfires have been fueled by several years of drought-dessicated vegetation and stoked by frequent and persistent bouts of erratic winds and triple-digit temperatures."}
