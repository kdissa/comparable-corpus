Landlines, mobiles and internet, which were cut off on Sunday evening, are yet to be restored even as tens of thousands of troops patrol the streets. The revocation of special status was expected to trigger widespread protests, but there is no word on how people have reacted to the news. Local leaders have also been detained."}
