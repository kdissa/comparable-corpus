After a dismal batting collapse by Sri Lanka, Afghanistan needed a rain-revised target of just 187 from 41 overs but were beaten by 34 runs. Afghanistan slipped to 57-5 in their chase but a partnership of 64 by Najibullah Zadran and captain Gulbadin Naib gave them hope. But Nuwan Pradeep returned and took two quick wickets before Najibullah was run out by Dimuth Karunaratne for 43. Victory would have been Afghanistanâ€™s second at a World Cup and first against a Test-playing nation at the tournament. Instead, Sri Lanka team their first win of the 2019 World Cup."}
