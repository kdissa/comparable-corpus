The second meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in Vietnam, was cut short after they failed to reach a deal on the extent of sanctions relief North Korea would get in exchange for steps to give up its nuclear program.He added that the relationship with North Korea seemed to be “very, very strong. “The United States and North Korea have said they intend to continue talks, but have not said when a next round might take place.While some credited Trump for refusing to be drawn into a bad deal, he was criticized for earlier praising Kim’s leadership and saying he accepted his assertion that he had not been aware of how an American student who died after 17 months a North Korean prison had been treated."}
