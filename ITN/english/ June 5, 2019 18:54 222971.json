The Minister emphasizes that not only one, but several no-confidence motions should be brought against the opposition for running an illegal government for a period of one month. According to Minister Mangala Samaraweera, the vast majority of the Tamil community did not have links with the LTTE and the Sinhalese majority was not aligned to the JVPâ€™s rebellion. He states that the vast majority of Muslims denounced extremism of a limited group of individuals. Mangala Samaraweera also noted that the Christian and Catholic community also reject certain racist and extremist moments in Christian traditions. The Minister highlighted that the polarized elements would attack moderate people who want to ensure peace and harmony in the society. He explained that if Rishad Bathiudeen supported the illegal government formed on the 26th of October, a no-confidence motion would not be brought against him."}
