The region ablaze includes remote, uninhabited forest in Krasnoyarsk, Yakutia and Irkutsk, creating what environmentalists have called an ecological catastrophe. The U.S. space agency NASA said this week its satellite imagery showed smoke from fires had wafted from Siberia and the Far East all the way to Alaska and along Canadaâ€™s west coast. Russia had deployed military planes to help firefighters battling the fires."}
