Guaido, who last month invoked a constitutional provision to declare himself president and has won the support of most the Western hemisphere, has repeatedly accused Maduro’s government of stealing public funds. Venezuelan traders say Maduro’s government has been using the Bandes subsidiary in Uruguay to get around debilitating U.S. sanctions that the administration of President Donald Trump has imposed in its bid to help the opposition oust Maduro. Uruguay, like Mexico, has chosen to stay neutral on Venezuela’s political crisis and instead called for dialogue."}
