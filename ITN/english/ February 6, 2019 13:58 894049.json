S-350 Vityaz is a Russia-made medium-range surface-to-air missile system with a firing range of 60 kilometers. Compared to the currently-used S-400, S-350 uses the same launcher and flat phased array radar, but comes at a lower cost. Russian press analysis shows that since the U.S. walked out on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Russia has felt the urgency to improve its air-defense capacity in Europe. According to plans of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian army will install a large number of S-350 over the next few years to replace the old S-300 anti-missile systems deployed in the western and northern parts of Russia."}
