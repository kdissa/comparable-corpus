Trump could be seen reading with a young girl during a visit to a classroom and later watched as children played soccer. Trump has made advocating for children her signature issue since becoming first lady. Ghana was the jumping-off point for her first major solo international trip to Africa, a continent her husband U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly referred to derisively. She will visit Kenya and Egypt as well. President Donald Trump has not visited Africa since taking office in 2017."}
