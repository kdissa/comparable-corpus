The reports said that work was underway at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station at Tongchang-ri, even as U.S. President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a second summit in Hanoi last week. That summit broke down over differences on how far North Korea was willing to limit its nuclear program and the degree of U.S. willingness to ease sanctions. A commercial satellite image taken on Saturday (March 2) purportedly shows the partially rebuilt rail-mounted rocket transfer structure at the station, according to researchers from Beyond Parallel, a CSIS project. The image was released on Tuesday. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, also warned on Tuesday that new sanctions could be introduced if Pyongyang did not scrap its nuclear weapons program."}
