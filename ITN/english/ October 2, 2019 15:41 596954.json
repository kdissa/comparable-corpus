Throssell added that fewer migrants had attempted the perilous journey across the Mediterranean with over 63,000 in 2019 compared to 141,472 in 2018, adding that the numbers show that “the journeys themselves are much more dangerous”. Throssell also underlined the “incredibly important” played by NGO boats in sea rescue operations. More than 18,000 people have lost their lives in Mediterranean crossings since 2014"}
