Civil rights activists Professor Chandragupta Thenuwara and Gamini Viyangoda petitioned court arguing that Mr Rajapaksa’s dual citizenship certificate issued after obtaining Sri Lankan citizenship in 2005 was invalid. The Criminal Investigations Department previously told the court that the Immigration Department had informed them that dual citizenship matters had been handled by the Defence Ministry in 2005. Accordingly, the petitioners claimed that the certificate had been issued by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when a cabinet of ministers had not been functioning. However, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Rajapaksa argued that former President Rajapaksa who was the Executive President at that time could exercise the powers of ministers when a cabinet was not functioning"}
