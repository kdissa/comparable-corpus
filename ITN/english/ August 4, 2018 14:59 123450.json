The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment on the report. The U.N report said North Korea is cooperating militarily with Syria and has been trying to sell weapons to Yemen’s Houthis. The report comes as Russia and China suggest the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met for the first time in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization."}
