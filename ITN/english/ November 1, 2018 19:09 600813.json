The foreign tourists who are visiting Sri Lanka said that although certain countries have issued various statements Sri Lanka is a safer country for them to visit. J. Louis from France said “I came to Sri Lanka for a twelve day visit. That is on the 25 of last month. The flowing day we heard the sound of crackers being lit. Wheninquiries were made one of the workers said that a new Prime Minister has been appointed. We heard the sound of crackers from all over the place. From that day onwards we toured many areas. We did not witness any disturbances. We received all from friends in France due to certain reports asking us to be careful when touring the island. But we did not witness any danger. The people live peacefully. A majority is happy about the changes. Why should the people be in a happy mood if a person like Hitler has come? From this itself it is very clear that these reports are false.” A Konter from Dubai said “I came from Dubai for a ten day visit. I came along with my friends. During our visit we received information of a political change. It did not affect us. We visited many cities in the island and enjoyed. In between our tour we heard from foreign media and friends that visiting Sri Lanka is dangerous. This was even mentioned in social websites. But we did not have any problems. Sri Lanka is a peaceful country. There are no obstacles to visit this beautiful country nor are there any altercations.”"}
