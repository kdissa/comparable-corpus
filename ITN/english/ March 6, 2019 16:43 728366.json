Hundreds of passengers were waiting outside the domestic terminal and riot police dispersed picketing ground staff, a Reuters witness said, adding that three planes took off at about 8:30 a.m. despite the strike. “Customers on flights after 11 a.m. are advised not to come to the airport until further communication is shared,” Kenya Airways said in a statement via social network Twitter. The strike at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport follows a labour dispute between the Kenya Aviation Workers Union (KAWU) and the airline. Union leader Moss Ndiema was arrested shortly after making a speech at the airport, media said. A court injunction had earlier ordered the suspension of the planned industrial action."}
