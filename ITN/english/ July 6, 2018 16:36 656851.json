China will impose extra 25 percent tariffs on 659 U.S. goods, ranging from soybeans and autos to seafood, worth $34 billion in response to the U.S. announcement that it will levy tariffs on Chinese imports, from today. China imported about $128 million worth of live lobsters from the United States in 2017, accounting for 15 to 20 percent of the total U.S. lobster exports."}
