Chanel, known for its extravagant runway displays, set the scene for its winter styles under an imposing recreation of the domed, neoclassical Institut de France, which houses the country’s language council and looms over the river.The first styles out of the blocks included an array of tweed suits, one of Chanel’s staples, reimagined for every collection by octogenarian designer Karl Lagerfeld, in shades of grey. Paris Haute Couture Week runs until Thursday (July 5). Only a handful belong to the selected Haute Couture club, as opposed to the fashion labels that present ready-to-wear collections. Chanel’s latest show comes weeks after the French brand lifted the lid on its financial results for the first time in its 108-year history, revealing itself as one of the biggest luxury labels in the world by sales."}
