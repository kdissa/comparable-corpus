{"Header": "Food price to come down with oil price reduction", "Time": " December 1, 2018 18:51 ", "Content": "Although the previous government as a policy increased the price of fuel on the 10th of each month, the present government decreased the fuel prices for the 3rd time within 34 days after coming into power. The people say that the previous government kept on pressurizing them although there was a possibility to provide relief such as this. The people say that the previous United National Party government burdened them by introducing a price formula for fuel and increasing price of fuel on the 10th of each month. On the 11th of October, a liter of 95 octane petrol was sold for 169 rupees. But it has been reduced to 159 at present. During the time of the previous government a liter of 92 octane petrol was 155 rupees. The present government reduced the price on three occasions and now it is being sold for 135 rupees. The price of other fuels has also been reduced. Therefore the people point out the previous government burdened them by introducing the pricing formula when there was a possibility such as this to reduce the price of fuel. Meanwhile Chairman of Sri Lanka Self-employees and Three Wheeler Association Sunil Jayawardena says they will reduce the minimum fare of three-wheeler to 50 rupees from midnight tomorrow considering the fuel price reduction of the government. Trade Union Representatives of the Restaurant Owners said that they would also reduce price of food taking into account the fuel concession given by the government."}
