The world number five appeared to have recovered from losing the opener on a tie break as he raced through the second set, but he paid the price for failing to convert his opportunities. Jaziri, 34, executed an audacious “tweener” shot to win a point at 2-5 down in the second set, and the Tunisian went on to claim his third victory over a top five opponent this season. Up next for the world number 61 is a first Tour meeting with Nikoloz Basilashvili. The Georgian, ranked 34 in the world, overcame Spain’s Fernando Verdasco 7-6(3) 6-4. Italy’s Fabio Fognini thumped Andrey Rublev 6-4 6-3 and will take on world number 45 Marton Fucsovics for the first time."}
