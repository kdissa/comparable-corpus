Strong winds of up to 190 kilometers-per-hour razed centuries-old pines in Trentino Alto Adige and Veneto, causing damage to the environmental heritage of Alps. In the Dolomites, thousands of red spruces were razed and dragged away while landslides blocked regional roads, isolating villages. The wave of bad weather, that hit the Peninsula from north to south, flooded much of Venice, leaving the lagoon city’s St. Mark’s Square under water."}
