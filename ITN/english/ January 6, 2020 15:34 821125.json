Former French Olympian, Thierry Rey, took hold of the flame in Bois-dâ€™Amont, France and set alight a cauldron, before it was carried back into Switzerland. Upon arrival in Switzerland, more ex-Olympians Vincent Defrasne and Vincent Gauthier Manuel also acted as bearers of the flame until it settled in the picturesque setting of Le Sentier."}
