Road and driversâ€™ organization ANWB said more than 1,000 km of roadways were snarled by the tractors, contributing to what it called the worst morning commute in Dutch history. Around 10,000 farmers are planning a protest in the city, home to the Dutch government, to argue they are unfairly being blamed after a court ruling found the country is violating European emission rules."}
