Municipal police said up to 180,000 protesters gathered in Barcelona pushing for independence. Demonstrators earlier obstructed major roads south of the city and a high-speed railway line in Girona. Catalonia held the vote on 1 October 2017 and its separatist government declared independence on 27 October. But Spainâ€™s constitutional court deemed the referendum illegal and Madrid imposed direct rule. At the time, there were ugly scenes on the streets as Spanish police tried to prevent people from going to the polls."}
