The team, led by astrophysicist Oscar Agertz at Lund Observatory and Mattias Wallerg√•rd at the Faculty of engineering, Lund University, will use data from more than a billion stars to develop an interactive galaxy model. It was collected from the Gaia satellite, launched by the European Space Agency in 2013. Gaia has been orbiting the Earth and collecting data for five years."}
