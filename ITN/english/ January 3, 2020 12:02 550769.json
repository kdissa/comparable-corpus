Australian authorities have declared an emergency warning for a fast moving bushfire in the country’s south, which threatened homes on the outer edges of Melbourne. In Victoria’s east, tens of thousands of people were evacuated on Monday as “columns of fire” fuelled by extreme heat and high winds bore down on the popular tourist region. As many as 11 emergency fire warnings were in place across the state, where conditions were expected to become extreme overnight."}
