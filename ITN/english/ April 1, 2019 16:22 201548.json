Chasing 176 runs to win, RR were off to a poor start as they lost Captain Ajinkya Rahane, Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson and were reduced to 14/3. Thereafter, Rahul Tripathi and Steve Smith stitched together a 61-run stand for the 4th wicket. But it was Imran Tahir, who dismissed Tripathi, who was batting on 39. His innings included 5 fours and a six. Smith also fell prey to Tahir as he was dismissed for 28. Ben Stokes (46) and Jofra Archer (24) brought the game to a closer finish courtesy some big hitting. But it was the smart bowling and captaincy by Dhoni that helped CSK prevail."}
