Rouhani added that the United States’ attempt to pressure Iran to negotiate through sanctions would not work. Speaking in Tehran, Rouhani went on to call the U.S. plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace, dubbed the ‘deal of the century’ by proponents of the agreement, as the “crime of the century”. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the plan last month which would set up a Palestinian state with strict conditions but allow Israel to take over long-contested Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank."}
