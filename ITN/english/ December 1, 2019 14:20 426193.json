Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi announced his resignation after a call from Iraq’s top Shi’ite Muslim cleric for the government to step down to end weeks of deadly unrest. The unrest, which has killed more than 400 people, mostly demonstrators, amounts to the biggest crisis confronting Iraq since Islamic State insurgents seized vast swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory in 2014."}
