Riots, demonstrations and acts of arson, much have reflected larger and long-simmering anger at the government’s failure to alter Chile’s economic course despite growing inequality, have resulted in at least 18 dead and 7,000 arrests. Chilean businesses lost more than $1.4 billion while the city’s metro suffered nearly $400 million in damages. Chile’s economy will likely grow between 2.0% and 2.2% in 2019, down from a prior forecast for 2.6% growth following more than two weeks of protests in the Andean nation."}
