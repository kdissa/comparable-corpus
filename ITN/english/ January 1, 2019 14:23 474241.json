Many of the ice sculptures at the festival come in different shapes and sizes, from miniature and cute creations to cathedrals and palaces towering more than 10 meters high. They are all made from the same ice blocks, and are lit up with a colorful array of lights. The 20 degrees below zero temperature cannot stop people from coming to the Ice and Snow World in Harbin. But behind the sparkling world, there are the efforts of many ice sculptors who have to endure freezing cold temperatures to chisel and carve huge blocks of ice. Guan Hongliang has been sculpting ice for a decade. As a Harbin local, he is pleased to see thousands of visitors adoring his works."}
