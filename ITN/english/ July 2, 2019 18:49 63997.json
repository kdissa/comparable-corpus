The travel publication, one of the most popular in the world, maintained Sri Lanka as number one, while warning readers to check travel advisories of their governments before travelling to the island nation. The publication says Sri Lanka deserves the top spot for its food, ‘epic train rides’, and scenic hills and beaches. Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka fell 70 percent in May, amidst foreign governments warning against travel to Sri Lanka.  Most such advisories have now been relaxed. Germany and Zimbabwe are ranked second and third among the top 10 countries to travel this year. This has been a huge victory for Sri Lanka, three months after the Easter attack. Economic analysts point out that the government’s concession to the tourism industry and strong security measures have also directly impacted to achieve the result. Meanwhile, there has been a significant increase in the number of tourist arrivals to the island in recent weeks. Our correspondents say tourists flock to historical sites such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya."}
