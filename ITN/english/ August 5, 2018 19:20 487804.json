He pointed out that the joint opposition acts not as a recognized political party, but as a political clique. Five political parties which contested the general election are representing the parliament. Minister Lakshman Kiriella pointed out that the joint opposition does not belong to those five political parties. A proposal has been submitted with the name of MP Dinesh Gunawardena for the post of opposition leader. It is reported that only 8 have signed the proposal. But the joint opposition says that 69 have signed the document. Minister Kiriella said that demanding of opposition leaders post by the joint opposition which work as a clique of the United Peoples Alliance cannot be justified. He further said that it was against parliamentary traditions."}
