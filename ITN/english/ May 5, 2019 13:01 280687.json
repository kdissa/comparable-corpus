Both Hetmyer and Gurkeerat hit blazing fifties as RCB recovered from a hopelessly placed 20 for three in the third over to reach the 176-run target with four balls to spare. The win meant RCB ended what has been a forgettable season on a positive note, while Sunrisers Hyderabadâ€™s hopes of securing a playoffs berth were kept on standby."}
