The Spain’s electoral committee banned Torra over his refusal to remove separatist symbols from government buildings. The ban refers to Torra’s position as a lawmaker in the region’s parliament but not his role as head of the regional government. Waving separatist flags and chanting “Torra President”, protesters walked towards Catalan parliament, where an extraordinary meeting was being held."}
