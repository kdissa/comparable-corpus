Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview on Wednesday he was dispatching a team to prepare for the summit to be held somewhere in Asia in late February. The last summit, which took place in Singapore in June, was the first such event between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The meeting resulted in a vague commitment by Kim to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But he has not yet taken concrete steps to that end, in Washington’s view. Trump said he was making “tremendous progress” with North Korea, but provided no evidence."}
