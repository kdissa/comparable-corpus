They indicated that the thaw may cause a new set of risks, including flooding on streets and in homes, ice jams in lakes, and slippery sidewalks and driveways. The national low temperature was measured at minus 48.9 degrees Celsius in Chicago, Illinois during the cold streak. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the bitterly cold temperatures were caused by the influence of the Polar Vortex, which is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding the North Pole, with strong counter-clockwise winds known as the jet stream that trap the cold around the Pole. As temperatures rose up, schools reopened, businesses resumed, and people are back on the streets that had been empty for days in Chicago."}
