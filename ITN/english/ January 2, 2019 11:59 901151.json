In a speech marking 40 years since the thaw in cross-strait relations, he reiterated Beijing’s call for peaceful unification on a one-country-two-systems basis.While Taiwan is self-governed and de-facto independent, Beijing considers the island to be a breakaway province. The Chinese president said both sides were part of the same Chinese family and that Taiwanese independence was “an adverse current from history and a dead end”.Taiwanese people “must understand that independence will only bring hardship,” Mr Xi said, adding Beijing would never tolerate any form of activity promoting Taiwanese independence. Instead, unification was “an inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people”."}
