RCB, on the other hand, suffered their fifth successive loss in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019. While Andre Russell lifted the Bengaluru crowd off their feet with seven sixes and a boundary, Shubman Gill scored the winning run as KKR chased down the tough target with five balls to spare.Needing 66 runs off 24 balls, KKR were up against it before Russell came in and smashed an unbeaten 48 to complete the job.Russell’s brutal hitting came after Virat Kohli (84 off 49) and AB de Villiers (63 off 32) recreated their “magic” with a delightful 108-run stand to take RCB to 205 for three. The result means KKR have now won three out of their four games while RCB are have lost five in a row and are heading towards another sorry season."}
