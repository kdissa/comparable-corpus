That was 17 percent more than the 60,000 acres it had burned as of late Monday. In Colorado, firefighters faced another day of hot temperatures, low humidity and gusting winds as they battled eight major blazes which have torched over 140,000 acres in the drought-stricken state.The largest wildfire, the Spring Fire burning in southern Colorado, grew by 18,000 acres overnight, ballooning to nearly 79,000 acres. It has destroyed at least 104 homes, forced the evacuations of several small communities, and closed a key mountain-pass road."}
