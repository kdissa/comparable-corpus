In his first speech, Naruhito said he said he would act according ti the Constitution and fulfill his responsibility as the symbol of the state. Akihito, the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries, became an active symbol of peace, reconciliation and democracy during his three-decade Heisei era. Many expect Naruhito to follow that model, but with his own style."}
