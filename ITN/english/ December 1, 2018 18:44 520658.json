He mentioned this during a media briefing. Minister Douglas Devananda said that the Tamil National Alliance says that they brought the Good Governance Government but the term of Northern Provincial Council has ended some months ago. The Minister said the Tamil National Alliance does not ask to hold an election. He pointed out that was how the TNA worked during the past. The Minister said that 10 Cabinet Papers have been approved to solve the problems of their people within a month of establishing this government. A program was launched to provide houses for the people who were affected by the war. There is a requirement of 110 thousand houses in the North and East. He said that they have taken steps to provide housing already. He further said that the Tamil National Alliance which was a partner of the United National Party deceived the people. Meanwhile Deputy Minister S. Viyalendran expressed his views during a function in Batticaloe. He pointed out that a President acceptable to the minorities is in power. Similarly a leader who is accepted by a majority of the people in the South has become the Prime Minister. Therefore he said this is the best opportunity to solve their problems."}
