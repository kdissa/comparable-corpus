A game ends when all teams shoot the relevant colours into the hoops at either end of the pitch and run back to the midfield to join their team-mates.A team earns one point if the ball is shot with the hand, two if it is shot with the foot and three points if it is shot with the head.All players participate without exception, there is equality, there is no elimination, he added.The sports-mad country has one of the best soccer national teams in Africa. It qualified 5 times to the World Cup, most recently in 2018. It was also crowned African champions once in 1976."}
