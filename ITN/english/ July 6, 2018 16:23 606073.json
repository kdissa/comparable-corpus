Yuan Zai’s caretaker made the special cakes with her favorite ingredients of water melon, apple and grapes. However, Yuan Zai did not show much interest in the birthday cakes. Instead, she was curious about the birthday cards that were hanging in her enclosure. Yuan Zai is now undergoing a state of “fake pregnancy” with symptoms of loss of appetite and lethargy. It is a normal phenomenon for female pandas of four to five years old going through maturation. Though she is not pregnant, Yuan Zai’s body produces hormones as if she is. Born on July 6, 2013, Yuan Zai is close to sexual maturity."}
