About a dozen cats, carried by their owners, walked the ‘catwalk’, in this case a red carpet, to raise awareness for animal adoption. All the proceeds of the event went to the Mayors Alliance for NYC’s Animals, which helps find homes for stray cats and dogs. The theme of the night was “The Purring 20’s”, and the cats were dressed accordingly, with fashion straight out of the jazz age. The hotel has a past well suited to the theme, as the Algonquin Round Table was a meeting place for famous authors, actors including Dorothy Parker, Noel Coward and Harpo Marx."}
