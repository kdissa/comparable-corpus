The latest recurrence of Santa Ana winds, howling into the region through mountain passes from the desert, coincided with extremely low relative humidity and a prolonged lack of rainfall that has left vegetation tinder-dry across the region.Those conditions prompted the National Weather Service to create a new alert level, issuing an “extreme red-flag warning” for fire danger in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.Winds were beginning to subside on Thursday, though red-flag warnings were extended through Friday evening in mountain and foothill areas deemed especially susceptible to high gusts."}
