People tried to cool off in the city’s ‘Plaza Mayor’, drinking at the outdoor cafes and using hand fans and umbrellas to combat the baking sun. Three men died last week in Spain as a result of soaring temperatures, two in the southeastern region of Murcia and one in Barcelona. Meanwhile, temperatures in Portugal, at the crest of a European heat wave, began to ease from near record levels, but a forest fire raged for a third day in the south, battled by 800 firefighters and 12 aircraft. Flames have consumed more than 1,000 hectares of forest, an area the size of over 1,200 soccer fields, in the hilly Monchique area in the southern Algarve region popular with tourists. Authorities deployed 130 soldiers to help with the efforts. In Perna da Negra local resident Antonio Marques was left to survey the ruins of his house, almost completely destroyed by the blaze. At the same time, two wildfires collectively called the Mendocino Complex grew to over 254,900 acres. Two wildfires make up the Mendocino Complex. The Ranch Fire which was 23 percent contained and the River Fire which was 58 percent contained. The fires burned in Mendocino, Lake and Colusa counties, about 90 miles north of San Francisco. The Mendocino Complex fires cover more than two-thirds the size of sprawling Los Angeles."}
