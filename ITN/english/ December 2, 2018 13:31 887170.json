Bethlehem, revered as the birthplace of Jesus, attracts thousands of tourists and Christian pilgrims in the festive Christmas time and the city authorities make the lighting of the tree into one of the most memorable celebrations of the year. With a height of 16.5 metres and decorations of 2,000 balls and 500 cords of light, the tree took workers 10 days to finish. Meanwhile, Rio de Janeiro’s floating Christmas tree was lit, officially kicking off the holiday season in the beachside city after a three-year absence. Thousands of tourists and locals flocked to the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon to watch the 70-metre high, 369-tonne tree light up for the first time this year, accompanied by a seven-minute fireworks display. The annual celebration has become a mainstay for tourists who came out in droves along with locals who came to be part of the celebration."}
