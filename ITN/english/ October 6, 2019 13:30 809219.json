Thousands marched outside the U.S. Embassy in the Greek capital, holding up signs that read “Pompeo go home,” and threw red paint on a statue of former U.S. president Harry Truman in the city centre. Greece and the United States have traditionally close relations even though many blame Washington for its tacit support for a military junta that ruled Greece between 1967 and 1974. Protest marches to the U.S. Embassy are an annual event."}
