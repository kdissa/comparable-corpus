The video was directed by John Landis just after sales started slipping of the album ‘Thriller’ after a year on top of the charts. Jackson proposed the idea to Landis and together they mostly self-funded the project. It marked the first time a music short film was produced, it had the biggest budget for any music video in history at the time and sales of the video and the already successful album sky-rocketed."}
