The Education Minister made this appeal at a media conference organized to raise awareness on the false report that was published in a national newspaper under the headline “All Schools will close on 04th of this month.” The Minister said that the Divaina newspaper has carried a report saying that schools will close on the 04th. He said that this IS actually an insult made on the 4.5 million children studying in schools. He queried as to the ethics of carrying such a news in a newspaper. He also queried whether schools can be closed in a manner to meet the needs of others. In the same newspaper there is an editorial saying that Akila should go to school again. He said that this matter was not to be questioned. He said very recently he made a reference to Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Hitler. Expressing his views at this news conference State Minister Ajith P. Perera said that schools will not close on the 04th. No one will be permitted to close down schools on the 04th. He said that teachers as well as children will attend schools on the 04th and that everyone who were subject to political victimization will be attending schools on the 04th of this month. He called on the children to attend schools as they would not close the schools. Further addressing the news conference held at the Education Ministry, the Minister said that a formal mechanism had been adhered to in the granting of teacher appointments to those who were subject to political victimization. The Minister pointed out that some were engaged in false campaigns with respect to the granting of these appointment."}
