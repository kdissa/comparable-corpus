The Spaniard, who started on pole position at the Termas de Rio Hondo circuit, now has 45 points to the Italian’s 41 after two races. Italian great Valentino Rossi finished second for Yamaha with Dovizioso, winner of the Qatar season-opener, third. Rossi passed Dovizioso on the last lap to take his first podium finish as a 40-year-old and first since he was second in Germany last July. Marquez won by more than nine seconds, making a lightning start and then pulling away to leave the rest to scrap for second."}
