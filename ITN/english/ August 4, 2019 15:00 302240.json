For the second night in a row, Kyrgios consulted a fan prior to his serve on match point with the spectator apparently advising him to aim for the top seedâ€™s backhand. Kyrgios did just that and Tsitsipas could only block the rocket of a serve back, setting up an easy forehand winner that ended the match on a hot and humid night in the U.S. capital. The world number 52 will be looking for his sixth career title when he faces third-seeded Russian Daniil Medvedev who eased past German Peter Gojowczyk 6-2 6-2 in the second semi-final ."}
