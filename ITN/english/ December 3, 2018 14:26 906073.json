Riot police were overwhelmed as protesters ran amok in Paris’s wealthiest neighbourhoods, torching dozens of cars, looting boutiques and smashing up luxury private homes and cafes in the worst disturbances the capital has seen since 1968. The unrest began as a backlash against fuel tax hikes but has spread. It poses the most formidable challenge yet to Emmanual Macron’s presidency, with the escalating violence and depth of public anger against his economic reforms catching the 40-year-old leader off-guard and battling to regain control. Macron ordered his prime minister to hold talks with political leaders and demonstrators, as he sought a way out of the nationwide protests."}
