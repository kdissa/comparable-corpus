Since leaving Formula One at the end of the 2018 season, Alonso has racked up two 24 Hours of Le Mans wins, was crowned 2018/19 FIA World Endurance Champion and finished 29th in the 2017 Indy 500. Seven-time champion in the car category Stephane Peterhansel expressed his excitement at the Dakar’s ‘new chapter’ in Saudi Arabia, as the 42nd edition makes its debut in the Middle East country, the first of a reported five-year contract."}
