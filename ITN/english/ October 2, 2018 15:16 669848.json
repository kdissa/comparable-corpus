The work, by Professor James P. Allison from the United States and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan, has led to the treatment of advanced, deadly skin cancer. The prize was awarded jointly to them “for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation,” according to the Nobel Committee. The treatment of cancers used to focus on the tumor cells while the new cancer therapy makes full use of the body’s immune system, which improves the efficiency of treatment."}
