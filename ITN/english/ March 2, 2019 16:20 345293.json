Several hundred people trickled out of the tiny cluster of hamlets and farmland around Baghouz, an eastern Syrian village on the bank of the Euphrates River. The majority were women and children, who were searched in the open and separated from the men, who were taken for interrogation. They bore various nationalities including Russian and Azerbaijani. Among them was a woman who said she was from Indonesia and had emigrated to IS territory but was now forced to leave to find food and medicine for her baby."}
