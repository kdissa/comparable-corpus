She said she had “never tendered any resignation”, but did not deny the authenticity of the recording. Hong Kong has seen months of anti-government protests. The protests were sparked by changes to a law that would allow extradition to mainland China, but have since widened to include calls for an independent inquiry into police brutality and demands for greater democracy. Ms Lam, who introduced the now-shelved bill, has been the target of much of the protesters’ anger."}
