{"Header": "Virginia governor apologizes for racist 1984 yearbook photo", "Time": " February 2, 2019 13:42 ", "Content": "Virginia Governor Ralph Northam apologized for a photograph on his 1984 medical school yearbook page showing two people at a party in racist garb, one smiling and in blackface and standing next to someone in a Ku Klux Klan costume. Northam, a Democrat, in his statement of apology indicated that he was one of the people in the photo, but did not state which one. His spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Virginia-Pilot on its website said it obtained a copy of the photo from the Eastern Virginia Medical School library. Northam said it would take time and effort to heal the damage. Northam, a pediatric neurologist, graduated from Norfolk medical school in 1984 and did his undergraduate work at Virginia Military Institute. The statement capped a tough week for the governor after Republicans accused him of advocating infanticide in response to comments Northam made defending a bill that would have lifted restrictions on later-term abortions. Northam was elected Virginia governor in 2017 after spending the previous decade in Virginiaâ€™s state legislature as a senator."}
