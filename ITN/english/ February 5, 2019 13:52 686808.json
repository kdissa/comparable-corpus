Nearly 30 people including three firefighters were injured. One person is in a serious condition. The death toll could still increase because rescue operations were still in progress on the upper floors of the eight-storey building. It is not clear what caused the blaze in Paris’ upmarket 16th arrondissement. A female suspect has been detained by the police. The Paris prosecutor, Rémi Heitz says the fire may have been deliberately started. Meanwhile, a fire in central Moscow claimed at least seven victims. The fire began in a fifth floor apartment of the building. The building is an architectural heritage site built in 1913. A number of cultural figures reside in that building, among them Lithuanian actress Ingeborga Dapkunaite. Russia’s investigative committee has opened an investigation into the matter, citing negligence as a possible culprit."}
