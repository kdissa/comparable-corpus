More than 50,000 tourists gathered along the Huangpu River to enjoy the charming night. The landmark Oriental Pearl Radio and TV Tower was decorated with red and golden lights, the colors of China’s national flag — to wish the country a happy birthday. Shanghai Tower, the second tallest building in the world, took on a brand new appearance, with projected words ” I Love You, China” spiraling upward to the top of the 632-meter-tall building. The Yuyuan Garden in the downtown area decorated with fabulous lights presented the traditional beauty of Shanghai. The first China International Import Expo will kick off in Shanghai in around a month. To brace for the event and fully present the beauty of the city, the landscape lighting of more than 300 buildings along the Huangpu River has been renovated."}
