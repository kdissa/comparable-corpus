Rasmiya Awad, 65, was detained in a raid near Azaz, the official said, referring to a Turkish-controlled Syrian town near the border. When captured, she was also accompanied by five children. Little independent information is available on Baghdadiâ€™s sister and Reuters was not immediately able to verify if the captured individual was her. Baghdadi killed himself last month when cornered in a tunnel during a raid by U.S. Special Forces in northwestern Syria."}
