Hurley has had a 42-year military career in the Australian Army culminating in his appointment as Chief of the Defence Force in 2011 and has served as the governor of the state of New South Wales for four years. The governor-general is appointed by Queen Elizabeth II in Commonwealth countries to be the Crown’s representative. Although infrequently used, the largely symbolic role of governor-general has extensive powers. He is commander in chief of the armed forces, appoints ambassadors, ministers and judges as well as giving royal assent to legislation and issuing writs to call elections."}
