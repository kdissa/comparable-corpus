The notification begins a one-year process of exiting the global climate change accord, culminating the day after the 2020 US election. The agreement brought together 188 nations to combat climate change. Announcing the plan last month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the agreement had imposed an “unfair economic burden” on the United States. The Paris agreement committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise."}
