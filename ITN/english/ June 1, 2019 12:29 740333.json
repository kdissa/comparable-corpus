In a tweet, Trump said he would hold a rally with his wife, Melania, Vice President Mike Pence and Penceâ€™s wife Karen at the 20,000-seat Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. But the official rollout for his 2020 campaign will take place around the four-year anniversary of the day in New York in 2016 when he rode the escalator at Trump Tower down to a crowd of supporters and announced his candidacy."}
