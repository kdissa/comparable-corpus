Navdeep Saini shone on his international debut, claiming 3 for 17 from his four overs as India kept West Indies to just 95. However, the visitors suffered six causalities along the way as they completed the chase only in the 18th over. The pitch had remained a mystery in the lead up to the game due to the inclement weather in Florida. Given the overnight rain and the dampness in the wicket, Virat Kohli had little hesitation in putting the opposition in first. The two-paced track notwithstanding, West Indies let themselves down in the batting department. They lost wickets early in a heap and then played catch up for majority of their innings despite a valiant 49 from Kieron Pollard."}
