Hazard’s 48th-minute penalty put the hosts ahead and Jonas Hoffman scored from close range after Gladbach pounced on a Dusseldorf defensive error in the 67th. The Belgium international then grabbed his second goal of the afternoon with eight minutes remaining with a deflected shot from 12 metres to take his tally to seven goals from the last seven Bundesliga matches. It was the hosts’ eighth successive home win in the Bundesliga, in a run stretching back to last season, and lifted them to second place, level on points with third-placed Bayern Munich, who drew at home against Freiburg."}
