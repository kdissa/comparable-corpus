The drugs have reached the first human trials after decades of research. Health officials warn that the declining efficacy of antibiotics threatens to unleash a post-antibiotic era in which even some minor infections could become fatal. By combining antibiotics with lysin, Dr. Vincent Fischetti, professor at The Rockefeller University in the Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology, successfully killed dangerous bacteria such as MRSA in mice."}
