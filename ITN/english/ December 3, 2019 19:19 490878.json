The suspects were produced before the Colombo Additional Magistrate and the Criminal Investigations Department informed the court that they have obtained statements from about 10 police officers in connection with the incident. The Colombo High Court considering a revision application filed by the Attorney General suspended the previous order given that the suspects be released on bail. It was emphasized that the Magistrateâ€™s court has no power to grant bail when the Attorney General has confirmed that the suspects have committed an offense under Section 296 of the Penal Code."}
