The slow-moving storm killed at least 35 people and forced 32,000 people into shelters after first coming ashore near Rockport, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico Coast. It hit the center of the U.S. oil and gas industry, dumping torrential rain that caused catastrophic flooding and battering the coast with winds of 130 miles an hour."}
