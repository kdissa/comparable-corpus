At a ceremony at the presidential palace, Vizcarra swore in 19 ministers, including Harvard-trained public administrator Maria Antonieta Alva as the new finance minister.It was the latest sign that Peru, the world’s number two copper producer and one of Latin America’s most open economies, was moving on from its worst political crisis in two decades, with dismissed lawmakers’ cries of “coup” fading from headlines in local media."}
