Thousands turned out to see Guaido speak in the San Bernadino neighbourhood. Just as Guaido was to take the stage, tear gas was released. Critics including opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, blame the electricity problems on corruption and mismanagement.Addressing his supporters, Guaido said he does not fear arrest. His comments come as the pro-government Supreme Court reiterated a previous measure blocking Guaido from leaving the country, which he openly violated in February.It added that the Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislature controlled by the Socialist Party, should discuss the issue of whether or not to strip Guaido of parliamentary immunity – a move that could pave the way for him being jailed."}
