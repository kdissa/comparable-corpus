He has mentioned this issuing a statement. As the Head of State President Maithripala Sirisena appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of the country. The President also appointed a Secretary to the Prime Minister. Under such circumstances there is no validity on the statement issued by Parliamentarian Sagala Ratnayake using a letter head of the Prime Minister’s Office. Mr. Welivita said that it contains false information. A statement issued by Rohan Welivita pointed out that it is totally illegal for Sagala Ratnayake to appear introducing himself as the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff using a letter head of the Prime Minister’s Office. The announcement further stated that there is no employee by the name of Sagala Ratnayake serving in the Prime Minister’s office."}
