October 2019 was 0.69°C warmer than the month’s average from 1981-2010. In Europe, the month was 1.1°C warmer than the average October in the same timespan. Many European countries saw above-average temperatures throughout the month with the exception of those in the north and northwest of the continent, Copernicus said, but European temperature anomalies are often larger than global ones, especially in winter. Temperatures were also above average in large parts of the Arctic, but the western part of the US and Canada experienced colder temperatures than usual."}
