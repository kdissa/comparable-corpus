Palladium overtook gold and platinum as the world’s most expensive metal earlier this year as demand from auto-makers outstripped supply. The element is used in vehicle exhaust systems to curb harmful emissions but manufacturers are currently only able to recover and recycle about a third. Now, chemists at Loughborough University in England say a species of fungus can simplify the recovery process; creating palladium nano-particles that can be re-used in other industries. In laboratory-based experiments, the researchers used white rot fungus, phanerochaete chrysosporium, to absorb palladium from industrial effluent and found it also reduced palladium ions to nanoparticles – a valuable commodity in their own right."}
