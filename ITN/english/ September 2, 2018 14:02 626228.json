The rare concession by the Joint Incident Assessment Team, an investigative entity set up by the coalition, follows mounting international pressure, including from allies, to do more to limit civilian casualties in the 3-1/2 year civil war.Fifty-one people were killed and a further 79 wounded, of which 56 were children in the Saudi-led coalition air strikes, the health minister for Yemenâ€™s armed Houthi group stated in early August. The Western-backed alliance fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthi group in Yemen said at the time that the air strikes had targeted missile launchers used to attack the southern Saudi city of Jizan a day earlier and accused the Houthis of using children as human shields."}
