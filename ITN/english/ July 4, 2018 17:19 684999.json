In the video, one of the boys – all of whom are wrapped in hypothermia blankets – can be heard saying “I’m hungry”. A medic replies, “They’re nearly here”. The footage was released by the Royal Thai Navy and was shot moments before another video posted on the Thai Navy SEALs’ Facebook page showed the boys identifying themselves and sending greetings to their family members and the public. The group were found alive on Monday (July 2) after nine days trapped deep inside the flooded Tham Luang cave complex. Seven members of the Thai Navy SEAL team are staying with the trapped boys, according to the SEAL commander. Rescuers now have to decide how best to get the group out in their weakened condition. Chiang Rai’s governor told reporters on Wednesday (July 4) that they were waiting to be 100 percent certain there were no risks involved in moving the boys."}
