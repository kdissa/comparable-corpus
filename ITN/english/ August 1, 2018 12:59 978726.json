Stem cells are the bodyâ€™s primitive cells which are capable of developing and multiplying into different biological tissue. They are also the cornerstone of regenerative medical science. Rene Garcia is a researcher of the National Autonomous University of Mexico leading this stem cell research. Garcia added that by harvesting these cells, whether from baby teeth or surgically-removed wisdom teeth, the cells could be multiplied, cryogenically frozen and used later in life in treatments to alleviate a variety of health problems."}
