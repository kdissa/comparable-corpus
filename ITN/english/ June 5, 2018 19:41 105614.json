France’s Julian Alaphilippe and Italian Vincenzo Nibali tried their luck solo in the last hill shortly before the finish, but they were reined in and Mitchelton-Scott rider Impey was the strongest of a reduced bunch. Alaphilippe took second place while Poland’s Michal Kwiatkowski retained the overall leader’s yellow jersey. The Criterium du Dauphine is the main warm-up race for the July 7-29 Tour de France."}
