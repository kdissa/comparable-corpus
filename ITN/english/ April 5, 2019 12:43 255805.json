Nearby businesses were evacuated while residents in the area were advised by the Metropolitan Fire Brigade to stay indoors and close windows. Hazardous waste collection and storage company Bradbury Industrial Services was the site of the blaze and the MFB’S Chief Officer Dan Stephens said that the premise was known to authorities. Australian media reported that the company had in March lost it’s license to store and dispose of industrial waste, with the Environment Protection Authority finding that Bradbury stored more waste than what was permitted. Stephens said the fire situation may continue for a number of days."}
