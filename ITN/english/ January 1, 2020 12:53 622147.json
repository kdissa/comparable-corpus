At least 43 homes were destroyed in East Gippsland, Victoria, while another 176 were lost in New South Wales. Thousands of people who were unable to evacuate fled to beaches as fires encircled their towns. Conditions have eased slightly, and a major road that was closed in Victoria was reopened for two hours on Wednesday to allow people to leave.
