The hosts had just two chances in the first half through Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben despite possession of close to 70 percent and playing against a team missing several key players, including top striker Nils Petersen.Freiburg grew bolder after the break and had the ball in the net only for Tim Kleindienstâ€™s header to be ruled offside."}
