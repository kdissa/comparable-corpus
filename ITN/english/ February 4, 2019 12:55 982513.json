Trump is popular in Israel because of his tough policies towards the Palestinians and Iran and his transfer last May of the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which he recognised as Israel’s capital in a break from long-standing U.S. policy. A spokesman for Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, whose logo adorns the sign over busy highways and streets, did not immediately respond to a query on whether the White House had authorised it to use the photograph."}
