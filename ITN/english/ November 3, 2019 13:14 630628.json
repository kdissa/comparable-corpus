Tel Abyad is one of two major border towns that were the initial focus of Turkey’s cross-border assault in recent weeks to capture territory from Kurdish militia in northern Syria. Turkey’s government blamed the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers Party for the “inhuman attack”. The Observatory said pro-Turkey fighters and civilians were among the dead and injured in the car explosion."}
