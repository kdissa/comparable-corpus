The victims included four men and seven women, including teenagers. Preliminary investigations indicated a standard pattern. While all the bodies were blindfolded, one of the bodies was found lying on the floor and the others hanging from a railing attached to the ceiling. One of the neighbours had spotted the hanging bodies early in the morning and reported it to the police."}
