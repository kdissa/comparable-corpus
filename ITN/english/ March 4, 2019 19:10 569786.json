The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation Services has taken initiatives to immediately rectify this insurance deal. The Ministry said that this has helped to save a sum of two million rupees for the Sri Lanka Transport Board. Prices were called from Insurance Companies to undertake insurance for buses of the Sri Lanka Transport Board, drivers and conductors and also for third party insurance during the period of the former Chairman of the Board. The Technical Committee which considered the proposals recommended to hand over the insurance activities to the Insurance Trust Fund. But it is reported that Former Chairman Ramal Siriwardena who headed the Procurement Committee had been considering to entrust the insurance activities to another Insurance Company which had submitted a bid higher than the Insurance Trust Fund. Minister Arjuna Ranatunge who took action following a complaint received in this respect had given instructions for the holding an immediate inquiry into the matter. Accordingly a decision was taken to entrust the insurance activities to the Insurance Trust Fund. A special inquiry has been launched to investigate as to why the Insurance Trust Fund that came forward to provide more benefits submitting a low bid was not given the insurance activities of the SLTB but had attempted to hand it over to another company that came forward to grant less benefits."}
