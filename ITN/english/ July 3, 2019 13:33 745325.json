The team’s Waste-to-Fuel technology proposes converting household refuse destined for landfill into a low carbon bio-substitute jet fuel using well-established technologies. Research fellow Dr Massimiliano Materazzi told Reuters that while the team’s waste-wind-wing production process is both clean and energy efficient, it also holds additional environmental advantages. While the UCL team is currently trialing the technology in the lab, they believe the method could have a significant effect on greenhouse gas emissions if adopted on a large scale."}
