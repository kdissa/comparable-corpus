He made this observation joining in the Kalutara District Muslim Conference Former Minister Imitiaz BakeerMarkar has said that SajithPremadasa has a vision on the country and is aware where the country should move forward and has a target. It is because he has a trust that when he faces the media he watchfully waits on his seat asking the media to raise any queries on any subject. He does not seek the support of Dulanjalee or the Prime Minister. He is aware of what he is doing. But Imitiaz BakeerMarkar said that media is a barred word for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. He attended only one media conference and in this conference only one question was raised, but without responding he looks at his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa on the right side and also he took as towards his left where G.L Peiris is seated. He is unaware as to where the country should be taken. Parliamentarian MujibarRahuman and Former Sri Lanka Freedom Party Beruwala Organizer M.M. Amjad also addressed the gathering."}
