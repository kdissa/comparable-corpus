After Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul hit the highest opening partnership of the tournament, a fine 180, India ran out of steam to post a disappointing 314. Bangladesh needed to win their final two games to have any chance of progressing to a first semi-final. But despite another half century from Shakib al Hasan they fell short. An England win against New Zealand in Durham today is likely to see both sides join India and holders Australia in next weekâ€™s semi-finals."}
