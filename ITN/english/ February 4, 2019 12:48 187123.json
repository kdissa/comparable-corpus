In a TV interview, he warned that US President Donald Trump would leave the White House “stained with blood” if he intervened in the crisis. He also defiantly rejected the EU’s Sunday deadline to call snap elections. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself interim president and won the backing of the US and others. Guaidó said on Sunday he would build an international coalition to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuelans. But Maduro has accused him of organising a coup."}
