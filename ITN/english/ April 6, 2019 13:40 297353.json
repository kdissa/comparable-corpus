Issak Hayik, who celebrates his 74th birthday next week, broke the Guinness World Record for the oldest living footballer after playing goalkeeper in an afternoon game with Israel’s Ironi Or Yehuda soccer club.The Iraqi-born sportsman received the formal title in an award ceremony attended by representatives from the Guinness World Record organization following the match. His family was among the tens of thousands of Iraqi Jews who fled in the mid-20th century to Israel, whose creation in 1948 and successive defeats of Arab armies caused bursts of popular anger and violence against Jews.Hayik’s children voiced pride in their father’s achievement. One of his sons said they used to play in semi-official matches together."}
