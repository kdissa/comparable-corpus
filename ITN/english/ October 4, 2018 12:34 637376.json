Gilmore saw off American Sage Erickson and World Junior Champion Vahine Fierro in her heat to progress to the next round, but only after rallying in the final five minutes with back-to-back waves. The Australian won her last WSL title in 2014. Elsewhere, USA’s Lakey Peterson – who’s second in the current standings – beat compatriot Courtney Conlogue and French local Pauline Ado, but Peterson must finish ahead of Gilmore to send the title race to the final event in Maui, Hawaii, USA.Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb – third in the standings – and 2015 WSL champion Carissa Moore were impressive as they breezed through their first heat."}
