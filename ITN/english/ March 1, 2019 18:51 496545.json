This centre gives irrigation engineers to take decisions on reservoirs depending on the specific information according to weather and climatic changes. The Modern Operations Centre built at the Polgolla Reservoir premises is scheduled to undertake water operations of all the Reservoirs and Dams including the Polgolla, Victoria, Maduru Oya, Kotmale, Randenigala, Moragahakanda and Kaluganga and that of the Uma Oya Reservoir which is under construction. The President yesterday inspected this operations Centre. This Project has been launched by the Mahaweli Authority under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena as Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment. This is the first time that such a Reservoir Operations Centre has been established within South Asia. Yesterday marked fifty years since the launch of the Mahaweli Scheme which is receiving a new vigour under the guidance of the incumbent President who directed the countryâ€™s economy to a new path. The then Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and Lands, Irrigation and Power Minister C.P. de Silva placed the maiden step of launching the Mahaweli mega plan on 28th February 1970, launching the construction of the Polgolla Bowatenne Reservoir. The concept of the mega Mahaweli five main reservoir concept which commenced from Polgolla at that time became a reality with President Maithripala Sirisena completing the Moragahakanda Kaluganga Reservoir and endowing to the nation. Meanwhile, an All Night Pirith Chanting was organized at the Polgolla Dam premises to mark the occasion, while it was followed by a Pinkama with the offering of alms to the Maha Sangha in the morning."}
