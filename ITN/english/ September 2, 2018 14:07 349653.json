Bush, once fierce rivals of the late Senator John McCain, praised him in eulogies on Saturday and joined his daughter at a memorial service in subtle and not-so-subtle rebukes of President Donald Trump.Without naming Trump, who did not attend the service, Meghan McCain took aim at Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” and said McCain’s America was always great.The former Republican Arizona senator died on Aug. 25 from brain cancer, days shy of his 82nd birthday. Nearly every major U.S. political leader attended the memorial service, and while Trump himself was absent, his presence was felt. And by design. McCain asked Obama and Bush to deliver eulogies while the family made clear that Trump was not welcome.Members of the military slowly carried the coffin into the soaring cathedral and back out again after the 2-1/2 hour service."}
