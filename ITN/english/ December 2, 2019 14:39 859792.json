The game got off to a fiery start with Gladbach taking the lead through Marcus Thuram in the third minute and Freiburg, who had lost only one of their previous nine league games, levelling as Jonathan Schmid scored from a free kick three minutes later. Embolo put the ball in the net a little later but his effort was ruled offside before Thuram hit the post for the hosts. Gladbach, however, shot out of the blocks after the restart, with the 22-year-old Embolo putting them ahead in the 46th minute from a Patrick Herrmann assist and then missing a penalty two minutes later."}
