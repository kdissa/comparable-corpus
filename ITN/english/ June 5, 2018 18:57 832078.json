Gazaâ€™s two million residents now receive only three to four hours of electricity per day, with schools, factories, hospitals and households affected. For the group of engineering students, the idea of using energy from the sea to generate electricity started out as a graduation project. But the tough living conditions in the strip have taken toll on the ambitious project. Some of the materials that the students needed were not available in local markets so they had to rework parts of old machines and even build some tools from scratch. Gaza has been controlled since 2007 by the Islamist group Hamas."}
