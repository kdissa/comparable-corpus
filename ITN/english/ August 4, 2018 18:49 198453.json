After introducing free education to the country, an incident occurred on the 1st of last year which is recorded in the history of education. It was the introduction of Suraksha Students’ Insurance Cover for about 4.5 million students studying at schools and pirivenas. Taking the process further, an agreement was signed for the special Suraksha Fund on the 30th of last month.  The fund has been setup by Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation on a request from Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Suraksha Students cover had a limit of 200 thousand rupees. The special Suraksha Fund was launched to help the students when that limit was exceeded. 100 million rupees has been deposited in the first phase of the fund. The Insurance Corporation agreed to credit another 400 million rupees to the fund. The government hopes to further increase the benefits of the insurance. Accordingly the students would be able to purchase equipment for hearing difficulties."}
