The visit comes as China-US relations have soured over a bitter trade war. Russia had decided on a pivot to the east years ago after ties worsened with the West over the Ukraine conflict. The two sides have signed a package of trade deals and Mr Xi also brought two pandas for the Moscow zoo. The Chinese president arrived on Wednesday and later gave a press conference where he said he had a “deep personal friendship” with his Russian counterpart. At the Moscow Zoo Mr Xi unveiled two panda bears, brought to Russia in April, which will remain a long-lasting reminder of the visit. After Mr Xi’s reception in the Kremlin and a visit to the Bolshoi theatre on Wednesday, he is scheduled to head for the Saint Petersburg Economic Forum on Thursday."}
