The region ablaze includes remote, uninhabited forest in Krasnoyarsk, Yakutia and Irkutsk, creating what environmentalists have called an ecological catastrophe. The U.S. space agency NASA said this week its satellite imagery showed smoke from fires had wafted from Siberia and the Far East all the way to Alaska and along Canadaâ€™s west coast. Meanwhile, firefighters battled wildfires in the Madrid region as they tried to stop the blaze from spreading into the Guadarrama National Park. Regional emergency services said the fire, which was reported in the Miraflores area did not pose a threat to inhabited areas. Thirty-five firefighters and 11 helicopters were deployed to contain the fire which has three focal points, the Madrid region emergency services said on their Twitter account."}
