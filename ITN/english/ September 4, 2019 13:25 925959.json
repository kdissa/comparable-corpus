The United States, Britain and France may be complicit in war crimes in Yemen by arming and providing intelligence and logistics support to a Saudi-led coalition that starves civilians as a war tactic. U.N. investigators compiled a secret list of possible international war crimes suspects, drawn from their latest report into violations during the four-year conflict between a coalition of Arab states and the Houthi movement that controls Yemenâ€™s capital. Investigators also highlighted the role Western countries play as key backers of the Arab states and Iran plays in support of the Houthis."}
