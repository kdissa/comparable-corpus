Beijing and Washington have been locked in a trade feud for the past 16 months although there are hopes that an initial deal offering some relief may be signed this month. If that fails, nearly all Chinese goods imports into the United States worth more than $500 billion could be subject to tariffs. U.S. imports from China subject to tariffs fell to $95 billion between January and June compared with $130 billion during the same period of the previous year while imports of non-tariffed items were broadly stable."}
