The train has a seating capacity of 1,283 people and can be used with the already existing stations, platforms and other high-speed railway facilities. The Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail line is 1,318 kilometers long and transports more than 400,000 passengers each day. The Fuxing bullet train first made its debut in June 2017, and the 16-carriage trains were put into operation in July 2018. Entirely designed and manufactured in China, the Fuxing, or Rejuvenation, trains are more spacious and energy-efficient, with a longer service life and better reliability than previous models.Over the past decade, high-speed railways have developed rapidly in China. The country currently has the worldâ€™s longest high-speed rail network, about a third of which has been designed to run at a speed of 350 km per hour."}
