With its equatorial sunlight, steady temperatures and year-round harvests, Brazil is also a fertile place for insects, fungi and weeds. To keep them at bay, farmers are applying more and more pesticides.For years, Brazil has been among the world’s top importers of pesticides, but locals and experts are beginning to wonder: at what cost? Since January 2019, the government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro approved 410 new pesticides according to local media. The government defends the use of the new pesticides as a means to raise productivity in the country’s important agriculture sector.
