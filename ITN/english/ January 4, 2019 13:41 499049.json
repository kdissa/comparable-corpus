They are the only five dance masters alive in the country today that are trying to past down the culture of Khol folk dance to the younger generation after the dance genre was almost entirely wiped out by the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. The dance masters belong to Lakhon Khol Wat Svay Andet, the only remaining heritage troupe in the Southeast Asian nation that was added to UNESCO’s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding in November. Cambodia’s Lakon Khol is based on an adaptation of the Ramayana India’s ancient folklore and is performed in theatres for rainfall and peace every year."}
