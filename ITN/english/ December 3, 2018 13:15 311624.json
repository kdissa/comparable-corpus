Rahm started the final round tied with Tony Finau and Henrik Stenson but turned it into a one-horse race with a seven-birdie seven-under-par 65 at Albany on the island of New Providence. He finished at 20-under 268, while American Finau birdied the last to claim second place on 16 under. Englishman Justin Rose was another shot back in third. Swede Stenson faded with a 71 to finish six shots back in fourth place in the elite 18-man field. Finau hung within striking distance of Rahm until a poor tee shot at the 14th led to a double bogey and pretty much sealed the deal for the Spaniard."}
