The country has a foreign reserve of 8.7 billion US dollars at present. The island nation was only able to maintain 6 billion US dollars of foreign reserves in 2016 and 7 billion US dollars in 2017, respectively. The International Monetary Fund agreed to provide 1.5 billion US dollars for three years as a loan in 2016. Under the extended arrangements of the IMF, Sri Lanka received another tranche of the loan to the tune of 252 million US dollars recently. Accordingly, the country has obtained around 1,014 million US dollars from the IMF so far. Another IMF team arrived in Sri Lanka last week to review the progress of the country and had a round of discussions with the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. The IMF has announced that Sri Lanka has gained a significant economic progress under the present administration while implementing economic programs successfully with the support of the IMF."}
