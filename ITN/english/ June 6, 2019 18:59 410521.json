The Department of Meteorology said that heavy falls above 100 mm can be expected at some places particularly in Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Kalutara District. Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Western, Southern, Central, Sabaragamuwa and North-western provinces. Showers or thundershowers may occur at several places elsewhere particularly after 2.00pm. Fairly heavy falls above 50mm can be expected at some places in Eastern, Uva and North-central Provinces. Fairly strong gusty winds up to 40 kmph are also likely over the country, particularly in the central hilly areas and over southern coastal areas. There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers. The public are called upon to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity. Meanwhile, the Met Department said that showers and winds are expected to continue over the South-western and Southern sea areas to the island as the south-west monsoon conditions are gradually establishing over the island. Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Hambantota via Colombo and Galle. Showers or thundershowers are also forecast at several places in the other sea areas around the island. Winds will be South-westerly and speed will be 30-40 kmph in the sea areas around the island. Navel and fishing communities are called upon to be vigilant in this respect."}
