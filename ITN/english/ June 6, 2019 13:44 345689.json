Aboard the spacecraft on its final flight was a small American flag. When the crew returned to earth, they left the flag for the next U.S.-launched crew to bring back home. Now Hurley, 52, hopes to be the one to retrieve the flag when he leaves the U.S. for space in the debut manned flight of the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule later this year or in 2020.Competing for that honor, though, is Hurley’s former crew mate Chris Ferguson, the final shuttle commander aboard the Atlantis. Ferguson is leading the crew of SpaceX’s competitor in NASA’s Commercial Crew Program — Boeing’s Starliner rocket and crew vehicle."}
