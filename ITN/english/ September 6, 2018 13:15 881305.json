India is likely to give its approval to a landmark military communications agreement with the United States during high-level talks on Thursday (September 6), two Indian government defence sources said, laying the ground for Washington to sell sensitive defence equipment.Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will meet their Indian counterparts in talks billed as a “2+2 Dialogue”. They are the first of their kind to take place between the United States and India, tweeted the official spokesperson of the Indian Foreign Ministry, Raveesh Kumar.The talks come as U.S. hostility rises towards India’s traditional allies Iran and Russia, targets of U.S. sanctions. Iran is a big oil supplier to India, and two-thirds of its military equipment is from Russia."}
