During an interview with Reuters the President said that a Cabinet Sub Committee has been appointed to strengthen the tourism industry. The President said that they have to hold the election in line with the constitution. Election cannot be postponed, therefore before holding the election he will bring about stability and eradicate terrorism. He said he is confident the security forces and intelligence will do that. According to the information around 130 people are involved in this organization. A fair number of them were killed as suicide bombers and some were killed in clashes with our security forces during search operations in the Sammanthurai area. There are around 25 to 30 suspects still at large. The intelligence agencies have found that ISIS have recruited Sri Lankans for the organization 15 years back. They have also gone abroad for training. The President said they did not get information that they were involved in terrorist activities or belonged to a terrorist organization. If they had that kind of information we could have arrested them. There is a level of normality in the country and tourists can come now. He said government will provide them with full security. We will also take responsibility for them. The President also said that the government can bring the economy back to normal."}
