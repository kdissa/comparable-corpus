Each chef chose to feature ingredients from their region of origin.The event was part of the seventh edition of an initiative by France’s state-owned SNCF rail organisation titled “Chefs de gare”, a play on the French words for “restaurant chef” and “station manager”.Friday’s event launches a series of events slated to be held from Oct. 4 to Oct. 13, which feature 27 chefs, as well as over 200 artisans across 37 train stations in the country."}
