After finding the 12 boys and their soccer coach alive, nine days after they went missing underground, attention turned to how to get them back out through several kilometres of dangerously flooded tunnels. But rescuers were no closer to deciding when and how this would happen. The navy has raised the possibility that the 13 could be in the Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai province until the flood waters recede, at the end of the rainy season in four months. But others say the boys could be out in a matter of days if the weather is on their side and water can be pumped out of the cave complex, and if they can be taught to use scuba gear."}
