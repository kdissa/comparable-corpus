The cubs were born at night on June 21-22 to a couple called Bagira and Sharkhan. Siberian tiger cubs, also known as Amur tigers or Ussuri tigers are the worldâ€™s northernmost tiger species. In the beginning of the 20th century the population of the Siberian tigers were declining with just dozens of animals inhabiting the Russian Far East. By 2015, the population increased to about 500, but scientists still consider the species endangered."}
