Bus driver Cristhian Lizama Fuentes told a dog hopped on his bus after a man and he thought they came together; after forty minutes, when he got to the final stop, some passengers told him the dog was still there. And that’s when he decided to film the brown dog resting. Lizama said after he filmed the video, he hopped off to buy some breakfast for him and the dog but when he came back, the dog was already gone. Meanwhile, a white moggy called Theo, who pawed and sat on his owner all night to stop her falling asleep after she developed a blood clot, was crowned British Cat of the Year. Theo, who died a few days ago, beat hundreds of other champion felines to take the top prize at the annual awards ceremony held at London’s prestigious Savoy hotel where his owner Charlotte Dixon collected the prize. Other prize winners included black and white cat Arthur, who took home the Most Caring Cat award for helping his owner Emily overcome mental health issues and Salem, who is companion to teenager Jared who suffers from muscular dystrophy."}
