In a tweet he warned of “a grave humanitarian mistake” in which hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Syrian government forces are said to be preparing a huge offensive on the last major rebel stronghold in the country. The UN says such a campaign could have disastrous consequences for thousands of civilians. Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Russia, Turkey and Iran will meet in Tehran on to discuss how to confront militants in Syria’s Idlib province. Zarif made the comments while on a visit to Damascus, where he met Syria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Meqdad and Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem. Muallem requested that Iran continue its support for Syria during the meeting, according to Fars News."}
