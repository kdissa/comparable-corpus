Addressing the nation, during the National Day commemoration, the President said that the Sri Lankan society should become a viable nation. The President mentioned that he believed that the people in the North lived freely during the last four years, after 35 years. We should understand the gravity of the ethnic issue without ridiculing or slandering the concepts of national unity and reconciliation. We should not forget we are living on a mound of ash, under which lies a simmering fire. The President declared that he strongly opposes the idea of the proposed national government. Whatever the reasons and whoever was responsible, we all, as political leaders have failed to bring about the economic development our country and the people expected for decades. The people of the country are no longer ready to continue in an economic recession while experimenting on economic development themes and rectifying errant ways. The political leaders who lead the country should be aware of this. The utmost priority should be given to the elimination of corruption and malpractices in the country. For that, we should be totally committed. So, we should defeat the drug trafficking and all the rackets and illegal activities that are causing a black economy in the country."}
