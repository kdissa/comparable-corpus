The blooming of blue-green algae or cyanobacteria is primarily caused by the excess of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus used in food production, in the water.Exceptionally hot weather and a lack of wind has exacerbated the effect. The Finnish Meteorological Institute said that this July was the hottest on record. Hanna Mazur-Marzec, a professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences’ Oceanology Institute in Sopot on the Baltic sea’s southern shore, said that the environment is giving us back what we have put into it."}
