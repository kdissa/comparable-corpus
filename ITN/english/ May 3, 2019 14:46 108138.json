Previously, Hungary’s PM Viktor Orban had demanded that the conservative party family EVP (Europaeische Volks Partie), which includes the CDU and the Christian Social Union, should work with the right-wing populist parties such as the Italian Lega. Merkel was in Niger to discuss with leaders of the G5 Sahel ways to combat Islamic extremism, which is on the rise in the region – particularly in Burkina Faso and Mali – and ways to curb migration which has fallen dramatically from Niger in the past two and a half years. Niger’s President Mahamadou Issoufou said the flow of migrants who used to come through the country via Agadez had halved as a result of the government’s strict policy. But Niger said they need more help in providing support for thousands of vulnerable people now living in camps on its territory."}
