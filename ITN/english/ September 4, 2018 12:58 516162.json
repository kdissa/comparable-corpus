Haqqani, who founded the network in the 1970s, relinquished operational leadership of the group some years ago to his son Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is now deputy leader of the Afghan Taliban. Haqqani rose to prominence as a guerrilla leader in the U.S.-backed campaign against Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan but later allied himself with the Taliban, fighting American troops after the Taliban were ousted in 2001. His group became known for complex, well-organized attacks on both Afghan and U.S. military as well as civilian targets and high-profile kidnappings."}
