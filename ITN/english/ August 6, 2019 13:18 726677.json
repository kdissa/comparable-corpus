But they are not looking for fish they are searching for abandoned fishing nets floating in the Indian Ocean. Also known as “ghost nets”, this often nylon plastic netting has caused serious environmental damage. It entangles marine life and degrades into microplastics that are eaten by fish, entering the food chain. It also snags boat propellers and damages engines. Non-profit animal welfare organisation World Animal Protection has said more than 100,000 whales, dolphins, seals and turtles get caught in abandoned or lost fishing nets, lines, traps and lobster pots each year."}
