The Sri Lanka Railway Service said that under the revision the minimum fare will not be changed for the first, second and third classes. However, the maximum distance that can be traveled with the minimum fare will be reduced from 9 kilometer to 7 kilometer. The train fares have been revised after a lapse of 10 years. There will also be change in the fee levied for season tickets along with the train fare revision. But the Sri Lanka Railway Service said that a change is not being effected to the percentage so far charged for season tickets. It further said that even after the revision that train fares are less than the bus fares."}
