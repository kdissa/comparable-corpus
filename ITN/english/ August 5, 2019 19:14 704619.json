He made this reference delivering a special statement today. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that several suggestions had been put forward during the final round of talks of the United National Party led alliance. Accordingly, he said that a need had arisen to delay the launch of the alliance to complete the relevant documentation. The Prime Minister who is also the leader of the UNP explained that the alliance would comprise political parties and organizations as well. However, he pointed out that the alliance would be formed by preserving the identity and the independence of these parties. Mr. Wickremesinghe observed that an alliance is necessary since a single party cannot win the presidential elections alone according to the current trend of politics. Premier Wickremasinghe also noted that their only objective is to win the presidential elections through a UNP-led alliance. He added that the alliance would contest at the upcoming parliamentary elections as well."}
