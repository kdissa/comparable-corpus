Frenchman Romain Bardet was second overall, narrowly ahead of Canada’s Michael Woods in third and Dutchman Tom Dumoulin in fourth with Italy’s Gianni Moscon finishing a little further behind in fifth. Valverde, who had previously finished on the podium a record six times without winning, edged clear of a four-way sprint for the title to take the rainbow jersey. He survived the brutal final climb up Hottinger Holl, a 3.2 km stretch with a maximum gradient of 28 percent, beginning the descent to the finish line with Bardet and Woods for company and Dutchman Tom Dumoulin in hot pursuit."}
