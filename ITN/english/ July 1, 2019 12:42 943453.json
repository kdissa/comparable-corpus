Dubbed the “millions march”, yesterday’s mass demonstrations were the first since security forces on June 3 killed more than 100 people during the bloody dispersal of a protest camp outside the military headquarters, the focal point of the protesters’ months-long struggle for democracy. There was a “huge turnout” in the capital, Khartoum, despite a widespread internet blackout."}
