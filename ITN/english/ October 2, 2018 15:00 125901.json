Health ministry spokesman Iraj Harirchi said 16 people had gone blind and 170 had undergone dialysis after trying the tainted drink. In the past three weeks, at least 460 people across five provinces have been hospitalised, with the youngest victim a 19-year-old woman. Alcohol is illegal in Iran but bootleg booze is widespread.
