Bees come and go along the line he signals, flying in unison as if riding an invisible highway in the air. A quick scan around his bee yard tells the story. Southern hemisphere spring showers once spawned meadows of dandelions in this vineyard-speckled Pacific coast town. Now there is just dust and hardpan. His story is typical of beekeepers large and small in much of central Chile, where a punishing, decade-long drought is making life difficult for honey bees."}
