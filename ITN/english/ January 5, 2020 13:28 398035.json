Djokovic stormed ahead in the first-set to a 4-1 lead, but the big-serving Anderson fought back in Brisbane to take the match to a tie-break. The multi-time Major Champion showed his class and mental toughness to edge out Anderson in the tie-break 7-5. Anderson, who lost to Djokovic in the Wimbledon final 2018, again took the Serbian to another tie-break in the second set. Meanwhile, Spain eased their way to a 2-0 lead over Georgia in the ATP Cup with victories from Rafa Nadal and Roberto Bautista Agut. World number one Rafa Nadal was broken in the first game of his match against Nikoloz Basilashvili in Perth, but he broke back immediately and went on to take the first set 6-3. Basilashvili impressed in the second set but did not have enough for Nadal, who eventually broke serve and won the match 6-3, 7-5."}
