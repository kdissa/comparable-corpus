The Minister made this reference joining in the ITN Sanvaadaya live programme. The Minister said that the values of the vote of the nominee of the United National Party shall be equal to fifty percent. He said that there are only ten members in the leadership Council. The UNPâ€™s power within it is fifty percent plus one. Altogether it would be fifty one per cent. He mentioned that the UNP as a single Party will have a strength of fifty one percent under this Constitution. At any time if anything undue takes place for the United National Party, the person who is representing the party in the Leadership Council will have a veto power to reject it. As such he said that the Constitution had been formulated so that anything undue to the party does not happen. Persons who expressed their views in this respect also joined in the discussion. Ranil Wickremasinghe undertook this journey along with these characters. The Minister said that there is an opinion that a single party cannot achieve victory. As an example he cited that if the UNP has 30 percent, it is a question as to how it is to get the balance twenty percent. As such a broad alliance is needed for this purpose. He said that it is the UNP that can form this broad alliance."}
