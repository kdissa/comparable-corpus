Felipe Gomez Alonzo, 8, died on Christmas Day. In early December, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal died after being detained along with her father by U.S. border agents in a remote part of New Mexico. Trump sees the wall as vital to stemming illegal immigration, while Democrats and some Republicans see it as impractical and costly."}
