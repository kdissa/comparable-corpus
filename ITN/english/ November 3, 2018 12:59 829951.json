Djokovic, who will return to world number one next week, had to overcome a nagging flu and formidable examination from Marin Cilic.The Croat took the first set and was a break up in the final set, but Djokovic fought back to take the match 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. Federer, in stark contrast, was hardly stretched at all in despatching Nishikori, beating the Japanese for a sixth straight time while not dropping serve."}
