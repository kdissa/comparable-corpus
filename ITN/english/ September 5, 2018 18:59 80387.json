The Joint Opposition had mentioned that they would surround all public institutions within the Colombo City. But the demonstration was an unsuccessful one. Leaders of the Joint Opposition left their residencies in luxurious vehicles to join in the protest campaign. But the ordinary masses attended the demonstration coming in normal transport services. This joint opposition rally will go down in history as a day in which the supporters of the Joint Opposition was offered alcohol using the wealth they had earned burgling public property during the period in which they were in power. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe in Parliament yesterday invited the Joint Opposition to come to Colombo to enjoy democracy in Seven Star Hotels. Supporters of the Joint Opposition were able to witness today the changes that have taken place during the three year rule of the present Government. Police attacks were a mandatory feature in protests staged during the previous regime. Unofficial power was vested in smashing heads of university students and public employees during the past Government period. There was an opportunity to secure stay orders from the judiciary against demonstrations. But the requests made to secure restraining orders by the Cinnamon Gardens, the Kollupitiya and Talangama Police as a step of preparedness to causing any damage by the Joint Opposition protest to the Presidential Official residence, Temple Trees and Parliament, were rejected by the judiciary. This is the manner in which freedom and independence of the judiciary mentioned in the Constitution are protected under this Government."}
