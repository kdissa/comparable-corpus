The 19-time grand slam champion will next face local favourite Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who beat German Jan-Lennard Struff 2-6 6-4 7-6(6), making the most of his wildcard status in Paris.The result ended Wawrinka’s hopes of qualifying for the season-ending ATP Finals, leaving only Frenchman Gael Monfils and Italian Matteo Berrettini with a chance to grab the last of eight spots at London’s O2 Arena. Sixth seed Alexander Zverev suffered a surprise defeat, losing 6-2 5-7 6-2 to Canadian Denis Shapovalov. The German looked out of sorts against a fired up Shapovalov who secured five breaks of serve."}
