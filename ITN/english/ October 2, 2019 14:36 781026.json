The head of the University of Costa Rica’s Insects Museum decided three years ago to replace animal protein in his diet with crickets, ants, cockroaches, beetles and other insects and wants to encourage others to do the same. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization has counted more than 1,900 insect species that are edible. Especially in Asia and in Africa, the tiny creatures are touted as delicacies packed with vitamins, minerals and energy."}
