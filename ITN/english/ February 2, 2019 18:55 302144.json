A statement issued by the Board said that drinking water sources in main reservoirs including the Central hills are drying up. The Board said that a low pressure situation could occur when distributing water to the consumers in higher elevations. However, the Water Board said that they would continue to provide water on all 24 hours of the day. The Board requests the public to use drinking water carefully. Meanwhile, our reporters say that water levels of Maussakelle and Castlereigh are decreasing rapidly. With the decrease of water in the Maussakelle reservoir, old buildings including Sri Shanmugam Hindu Kovil and the Mosque at the previous Maskeliya town have surfaced."}
