Hundreds of protesters thronged the terminal and set up barricade with trolleys after a brief confrontation with the airport officials. Protest organisers have urged the public to overwhelm road and rail links to the airport, one of the world’s busiest, on Sunday and Monday, potentially disrupting flights. People would begin gathering at 1 p.m. (0500 GMT), protest groups said."}
