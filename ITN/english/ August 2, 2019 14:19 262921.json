Two people have died of the disease in Uganda, which also borders Congo, but there have been no registered cases in Rwanda.Earlier on Thursday Lucien Kalusha, a Congolese hairdresser who crosses every day to work in Rwanda, told Reuters he and others had not been able to cross.Congolese health authorities confirmed that a third case had been diagnosed in Goma, increasing fears the virus could take root in the densely populated city, which lies more than 350 km (220 miles) south of where the outbreak was first detected."}
