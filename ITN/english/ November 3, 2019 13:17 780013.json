The death toll remained provisional as corpses were undergoing identification and that the army was undertaking a combing operation on the ground with support from international forces, including French troops from the Barkhane operation and U.N. peacekeepers. The attack follows jihadist raids in late September that underscored the increasing reach and sophistication of armed groups operating in the region."}
