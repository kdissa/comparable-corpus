Nadal began at a frightening pace and dropped one point on serve in the opening set and try as he might Goffin could not get much closer to the marauding Mallorcan in the second. It had looked like the boxing equivalent of a heavyweight taking on a lightweight, but Goffin showed some steel to go with his silky strokes to punch his way back into contention.With the crowd offering the Belgian plenty of backing, he broke Nadal’s serve out of nowhere at 4-4 and then held to extend the contest into the early evening sunshine."}
