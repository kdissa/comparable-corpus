A large crowd and Vietnamese officials saw off Kim Jong Un at the border station of Dong Dang. He visited a war heros monument and the mausoleum of former president Ho Chi Minh before travelling to the station where he boarded his train for the journey back to Pyongyang which will take him and his entourage through China. Kim came to Hanoi for a second meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam, which was cut short after they failed to reach a deal on the extent of sanctions relief North Korea would get in exchange for steps to give up its nuclear programme."}
