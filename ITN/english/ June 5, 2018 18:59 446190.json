But a team of Indian engineers have figured out a way to bring some good from choking generator exhaust. They are capturing the soot from the fumes and turning it into ink. They have created what they say is the first ever device to capture emissions specifically from diesel generators a welcome invention for a country which has 14 of the 15 most polluted cities in the world. The idea, Dhupar said, came about when he and his co-founders stopped at a sugar cane juice stall on a hot day."}
