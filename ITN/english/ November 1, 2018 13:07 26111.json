Leigh won the first race of the day but it was in the second round that his battle with Toro Rosso’s Frederik Rasmussen for first place got heated on the track.Rasmussen had overtaken Leigh towards the end of the race, but as the Brit tried to retake the lead he made contact with his rival. It was a move that clearly frustrated Leigh, who eventually finished first despite the tense finish.Leigh, who has gone fully professional and shed 20 kilos since a title win that changed his life, finished fifth in the final race set in Belgium."}
