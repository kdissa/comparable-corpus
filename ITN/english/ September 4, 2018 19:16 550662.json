Addressing newsmen, the Deputy Minister pointed out that marriages had also been held earlier at Temple Trees. But the expenditure on these marriages including that of the food, was met from state funds with the full sponsorship of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. But it was not so with the wedding of Chathura Senaratne. Only the hall, electricity and air condition was provided. A payment of 21 million 80 thousand rupees had been paid for securing the hall. The hall could be obtained at the rate of 40 thousand rupees per hour for any function. He said that anyone who wishes to hold the marriage at Temple Trees can do so. The Deputy Minister also elaborated on the difference between the present and past regimes. The Deputy Minister said that the Prime Minister was at present using Temple Trees as his office only. He spends night at his residence. Temple Tree is not a dansala unlike during the Rajapaksa regime. It has not been made a centre wasting state funds."}
