While the WSJ did not really make any major new revelations, it did manage to reignite the conversation about privacy, and Google has responded to storm that has built up around it. The company has used a blog post to respond to the concerns raised by the Wall Street Journal, insisting that it carefully vets any third party that has access to sensitive data. The task has been left to Suzanne Frey (Director of security, trust and privacy at Google Cloud) to limit the damage caused by the article. Gmail, which was launched in 2004, is the most popular email service in the world with 1.4 billion users worldwide."}
