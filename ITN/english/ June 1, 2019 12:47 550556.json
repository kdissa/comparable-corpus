According to Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology (INGV), the eruption was preceded by a few weeks of isolated seismic events before two fissures opened on the New Southeast Crater. The northern lava flow reached a distance of around two km on Friday (May 31) morning, INGV reported, whilst the southern flow reached an estimated total length of three km. The 3,330-metre high volcano often erupts but rarely causes damage. Catania airport currently remains open."}
