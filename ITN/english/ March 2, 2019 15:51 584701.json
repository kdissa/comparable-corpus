With teams packing up and heading home before the opening race in Australia on March 17th , the evidence from eight days at Barcelona’s Circuit de Catulunya suggested there was very little in it between the two. Vettel’s best effort of one minute 16.221 seconds last morning was faster than anyone else went in Spain but Hamilton ended the final day only 0.003 slower on the same C5 tyres. The Briton, who was actually faster than Ferrari on the second-softest C4 tyres, earlier told reporters he felt the Italians were much further ahead. Hamilton’s Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas was third fastest in 1:16.561 — also on C5 rubber — as Mercedes turned their focus to single lap pace after concentrating on longer runs."}
