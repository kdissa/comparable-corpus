Lemurs and Asian elephants were given ice cream and watermelons as part of a heatstroke prevention programme that started at the end of May, and is set to continue on to November. Waterfalls have also been in use to help cool down the surrounding air, which measured about 37 degrees Celsius around noon. When the temperature hits 35 degrees Celsius, ice cubes are delivered to the enclosures of leopard, capuchin monkeys and tigers."}
