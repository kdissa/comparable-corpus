A trawler carrying three Somalian fishermen was stranded in the Southern Sea due to a technical fault. A fisheries trawler that ventured into the sea from Galle had witnessed these stranded Somalians about 200 nautical miles from Galle. Thereafter these Somalians had sought help from the Sri Lankan fishermen. The request made by the Somalians was intimated by the Sri Lankan fishermen to the Southern Naval Command base. Thereafter the Navy began an operation for the rescue of these Somalian fishermen. The Navy which launched the operation from the Nandimithra vessel rescued the Somalians and handed them over to the Galle Harbour Police for further investigations. These fishermen have been admitted to the Karapitiya Hospital."}
