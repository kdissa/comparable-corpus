But delays in obtaining construction permits pushed up building costs, as the falling lira drove up prices of building materials. The company – like other construction firms in Turkey- felt the pain of a falling currency and rising interest rates.Work at the resort was halted last year, before all 732 castles were completed, and the company was declared bankrupt.On Friday a majority of creditors of the firm, Sarot Turizm, voted for it to continue building at the complex in the town of Mudurnu, using company capital and assets, company lawyer Ozgur Yanar told Reuters."}
