The ruling was given by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne. Jeffrey Joseph Aloysius requested not to impose a limit on his foreign travel. But the Magistrate issued the order rejecting the request. His lawyer requested that the limit on foreign travel should not be imposed as Jeffrey Joseph Aloysius has so far supported in the investigations and no evidence has surfaced that he would flee the country. The Magistrate said that his request cannot be granted as the Perpetual Treasuries Board of Directors had to bear the responsibility with respect to the allegations. In the meantime the owner of Perpetual Treasuries Limited Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were further remanded until 19 th of July. The AGâ€™s Department also informed the courts that three phones and five SIM cards were found in the prison ward of Arjun Aloysius.It was also revealed that the authorities have found a phone under his mattress."}
