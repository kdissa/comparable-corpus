The buyer is a French private individual who has promised the mystery dinosaur fossil will still be visible by the public, auctioneer in charge of the sale Claude Aguttes told Reuters. Almost nine metres long, the skeleton is unusually complete, at almost 70 percent whole. It is believed to be from the carnivorous, theropod group of dinosaurs, which had hollow bones and three-toed feet. But beyond that scientists are still stumped and have spotted differences with known species, such as more teeth and a more substantial pelvis."}
