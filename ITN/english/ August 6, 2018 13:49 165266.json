UK hosts epic lawn mower race", "Time": " August 6, 2018 13:49 ", "Content": "A muddy lawn mower endurance race in the UK proved to be arguably the greatest show on turf over a warm August weekend. Starting, running all the way through the night and finally finishing the next morning after 12 exhausting hours the race in Sussex, England featured 43 teams from all over the world. The race, which apparently started in 1973 when motor sports fans met in a pub and decided to start a cheap, competitive racing event, is a quirky highlight of the sportâ€™s calendar. Before the competition got going, a water bowser was used on the track to dampen the circuit to try and minimise the dust blowing across the course, making it hard for drivers to see."}
