The reports come after the army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah, renewed a call for the Constitutional Council to declare the ailing 82-year-old Bouteflika unfit to rule. Bouteflika said on March 11 he was dropping plans for a fifth term but stopped short of stepping down immediately, to wait for a national conference on political change. That further enraged protesters, prompting Salah to step in by proposing last week to ask the constitutional council to see whether he is still fit for office."}
