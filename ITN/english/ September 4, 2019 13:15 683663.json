The Commons voted 328 to 301 to take control of the agenda, allowing them to bring a bill requesting a Brexit delay. The PM is to call for a general election if he is forced to request an extension to the 31 October deadline. MPs will now vote on the Brexit delay bill. If it passes, the vote on whether to hold an election will follow. Wednesday in the Commons will also see Chancellor Sajid Javid outline the governmentâ€™s spending plans, with the health service, education and the police expected to fare well."}
