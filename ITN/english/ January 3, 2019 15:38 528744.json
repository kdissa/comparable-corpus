James Neesham providing a blitzy finish with his unbeaten 47 off 13, which included fives sixes in an over off Thisara Perera.Guptill had last played an ODI in March last year against England at home before New Zealand cricket went into hibernation. When it was time to hit the park again, in the tour to UAE against Pakistan, he was sidelined due to a calf injury. Returning to the side after a long lay-off, the opener had acknowledged he felt rusty entering the series but was quick to point out that he was prepared. Given the opportunity to make first use of good batting conditions, he walked out and slammed 138 off 139 to re-establish his credentials as the first-choice opener in the 2019 World Cup for New Zealand."}
