It described the organisation, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , as “irredeemably flawed”.The US administration has “carefully reviewed” the issue and will not make additional contributions to Unrwa. A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later said the move was an “assault” against his people. He added that the decision was “a defiance of UN resolutions”.A spokesman for Unrwa, Chris Gunness, defended the agency in a series of tweets. The latest move comes after the US announced back in January that it would withhold more than half of a tranche of funding for the agency."}
