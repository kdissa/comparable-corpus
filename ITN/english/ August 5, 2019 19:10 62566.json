There are some who are not interested in taking it into consideration. He said that he decided to impose the death penalty as the issue had spread fast. There are some who pull by the leg when something good was to be done. But he said that he is satisfied about a report that has been sent by the Attorney General recently. The report had mentioned that a private resolution tabled by a Government MP to invalidate the death penalty is not legal."}
