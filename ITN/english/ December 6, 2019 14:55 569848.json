The countries involved pump over 40% of the worldâ€™s oil, and their new combined cuts amount to 1.7 million bpd or 1.7% of global production. A panel of energy ministers representing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia recommended the deeper cut."}
