In response, Eurotunnel, which operates railway services between the UK and France, said it would withdraw its file against the UK government on its “secretive” deals with three ferry companies at the end of 2018. The UK government and Eurotunnel agreed that the latter would use the money to improve infrastructure on the UK side of the British-French tunnel, add more quarantine and customs examinations to brace for cross-border transportations after Brexit. And according to the deal, the tunnel will be the main passage for cross-border bulk goods transport after Britain officially leaves the European Union."}
