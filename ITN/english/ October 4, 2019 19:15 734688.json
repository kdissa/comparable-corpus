Meanwhile General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party said that their party had no links with this petition. Delivering the verdict the Supreme Court said that there is no legal basis to take up the petition for consideration. Former Mayor of Galle Methsiri de Silva had submitted the petition to the Court. The petitioner had requested the Court to issue an order suspending the calling of nominations on the 07th of October. He had mentioned in his petition that the President’s term of office is six years and if it was limited to five years it would hinder the sovereignty of the people. Meanwhile, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara has said that neither the President nor the Sri Lanka Freedom Party had any links to this petition.  Joining in the ITN Sanvadaya programme yesterday, Dayasiri Jayasekra said that there is a right for anyone to approach the judiciary. On his way to this programme he said he wanted to find out as to who had filed this petition. He said that Methsiri is one of their organizers. He was unaware that he had been removed. As the General Secretary of the SLFP he said he was unaware of it. He said that he was not consulted about the matter."}
