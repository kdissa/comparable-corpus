Aerial images showed a control tower and the roof of an airplane hanger rising from the water. Nearby, the empty stands at Lakeside Speedway, a dirt auto race course, were surrounded by water. Major waterways severely bloated by torrential downpours spilled over levees and flooded mostly agricultural land throughout Missouri, Arkansas and other parts of the Midwest. Relentless rain and deadly tornadoes have been blamed for at least 16 deaths across several states in the nationâ€™s midsection, turning highways into lakes and nearly submerging homes in Arkansas, Louisiana, Illinois and Oklahoma."}
