Protesters waved witty and sometimes rude placards at what organizers called the “Carnival of Resistance” in Trafalgar Square, while Prime Minister Theresa May was in talks with the president a short distance away in Downing Street. The tone at the protest was set by giant robot depicting Trump sitting on a golden toilet with his trousers around his ankles, tweeting and saying: “Fake news.”"}
