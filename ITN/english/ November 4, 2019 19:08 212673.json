He made this reference joining in a public meeting held in the Hulftsdorp area. This public rally was held in the Hulftsdorp area in Colombo to consolidate the victory of Presidential candidate of the National Peoples Power Movement Aura Kumara Dissanayake. A large gathering including activists of the JanathaVimukthiPeramuna joined in this meeting. Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that if these rulers were to run the country, it is mandatory that problems will continue to surface over and over again. They want to have clashes. If there was no terrorist attack on April 21st what would they have to talk in their political platforms. It was because of this 21st attack that a former Defence Secretary became a Presidential candidate. As such it is the reason that he has come to the stage and making a statement that he would assure the security of the country. They do not have politics if there were no clashes. Anura Kumara said this was what the other side was also saying. They were mentioning that it was they who represent the other side. They need clashes and they cannot engage in politics only with economic problems. They cannot only do politics with education and democracy. They do not talk about health as they cannot improve it. They can only engage in politics by crafting clashes. As such if these two political camps are not being removed from power, clashes will erupt over and over again. He told the gathering that if they were select one of these two old parties, they should be ready for a clash. He said that if the people were ready to select National Peoples Power Movement they would be prepared to build unity among the people through their movement."}
