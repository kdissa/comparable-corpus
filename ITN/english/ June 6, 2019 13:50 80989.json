Switzerland levelled in the second period when Ricardo Rodriguez tucked away a video assistant referee-awarded penalty – after Felix Brych had initially signalled for a penalty at the other end. But after consulting his pitch-side monitor, referee Brych instead gave a spot-kick for Nelson Semedo’s foul on Switzerland’s Steven Zuber.Incensed by the decision, the hosts struggled to build any rhythm as the game appeared to drift towards extra-time.However, Ronaldo made the crucial difference late on, sweeping Bernardo Silva’s cross into the corner of the net, before firing into the same spot 102 seconds later."}
