Entangling as many quantum bits as possible can lead to an exponential increase of quantum computing speed. However, scientists are facing a huge challenge to entangle a large amount of quantum bits. A group of Chinese scientists for the first time entangled as many as 18 quantum bits by adopting a new technology called the multi-degrees of freedom photon control method. Lu added that this achievement can be used in large-scale, high-efficiency quantum information technology, and can be regarded as a milestone in the technologyâ€™s development."}
