The glyphosate ban was in effect from year 2015. Minister Naveen Dissanayake addressing a media briefing said that the government expects to remove glyphosate totally from the market after introducing substitutes in the future. The Minister said that no scientific evidence has been found that glyphosate is related to kidney disease spreading in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan tea is in danger of being banned from Japan due to use of an herbicide called MCPA instead of glyphosate. Due to the impact caused on the tea industry, a 20 billion rupee income would be lost for Sri Lanka. The Minister emphasized that glyphosate will be removed from the market gradually. He also said that no organic herbicide has been introduced in the market yet to replace glyphosate. Sri Lankaâ€™s Tea Research Institute is making an attempt to produce a type of organic herbicide in Sri Lanka."}
