Meanwhile,Revellers filled the streets of Torres Vedras, the home of Portugal’s most famous carnival, as satirical floats featuring world renown figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had it out over the “Dover of Peace.” Other revellers dressed as bottles of vintage port danced as they promoted Portugal’s very own wine and a figure of Cristiano Ronaldo, the country’s most famous sportsman, also made an appearance."}
