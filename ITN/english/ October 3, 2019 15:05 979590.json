The launch came a day after it announced the resumption of talks with the United States on ending its nuclear programme. It is seen by analysts as the most provocative test by North Korea since it started the talks with the United States in 2018.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “sent warm congratulations” to those who had carried out the successful test-firing, KCNA said, indicating that Kim was not at the site."}
