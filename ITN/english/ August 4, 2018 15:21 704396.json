A video uploaded to social media by Angel Gonzalez and filmed from the car behind, showed the moment the rhino attacks the van and the van driving away as zoo keepers run behind the animal. According to a statement by Africam Safari, the male rhino’s aggressive behaviour was due to the presence of a female rhino nearby, and that this was an “isolated case”. Local media reported no one was injured and that the rhino is now in a different section."}
