China’s embassy in Canada protested at the arrest and demanded her release.Huawei said it had little information about the charges and was “not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng”.The arrest comes at a sensitive time for US-China relations. The nations are engaged in a trade war that has seen both impose duties of billions of dollars on one another’s goods.The arrest will not help the 90-day tariff truce the nations agreed after President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met at the G20."}
