The blast, which shook buildings several kilometres away, came just as Zalmay Khalilzad, the special U.S. envoy for peace in Afghanistan was outlining details of a draft accord with the insurgent movement in a television interview. Following major Taliban attacks on two northern cities over the weekend, the bombing in a heavily populated area of the capital added to questions around the peace deal reached between U.S. and Taliban negotiators."}
