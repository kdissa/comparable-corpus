The unseasonal snowfall cut off the Kashmir valley and led to the closure of the Srinagar-Jammu national highway. The northern city of Srinagar, in Jammu and Kashmir, typically sees its first snowfall much later, usually between the months of December and February. Snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh has a direct impact on temperatures in lower northern states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Indian capital New Delhi."}
