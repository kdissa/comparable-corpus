The 21-year-old Mercedes-backed Briton, last year’s Formula Two title winner, has languished at the rear of the field since he made his F1 debut with struggling former champions Williams in Australia last month.Russell tested with champions Mercedes last year, setting a track record in Hungary in August, and enjoyed being back up to speed with a best lap of one minute 29.029 seconds at the Sakhir circuit.His time, in warm and dry conditions after Tuesday’s rain, was the fastest over the two days of testing in Bahrain following Sunday’s grand prix won by Mercedes’ five times champion Lewis Hamilton. Mexican Sergio Perez was second fastest for Racing Point, also on the softest C5 compound, with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel third on the harder C3."}
