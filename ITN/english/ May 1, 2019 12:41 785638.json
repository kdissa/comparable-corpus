We hope he’ll reconsider and get back on that plane,” Pompeo told Fox News. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido appeared alongside armed, uniformed men on Tuesday in his strongest call yet to the military to abandon Maduro, a day before planned mass protests aimed at toppling the socialist leader."}
