BMC rider De Marchi was part of an initial 19-man breakaway on the longest stage of this year’s Vuelta – a 208.8 kilometre intermediate stage starting in Mombuey. French rider Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) and BMC’s Dylan Teuns distanced themselves from the their fellow breakaway riders, but Pinot would eventually finish nearly two minutes off the stage winner – despite at one stage threatening the red jersey. But BMC took control of the race and that enabled De Marchi to burst clear with Katusha-Alpecin’s Restrepo on the final climb. But as the weather worsened, De Marchi found another gear as he dropped the Colombian before cantering to victory by 28 seconds, as Restrepo had to settle for second place – with Bahrain-Merida’s Franco Pellizotti 31 seconds further back in third."}
