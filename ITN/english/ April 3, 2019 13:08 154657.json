On a surprisingly wet day at the same track where his father won the first grand prix in the Middle East with Ferrari 15 years ago, Schumacher was 0.597 seconds slower than the 21-year-old Dutchman. His time of one minute 29.976 seconds was set on the softest, and fastest, C5 tires softer than anyone else’s and he completed 56 laps on a day where track time was limited by bad weather washing out much of the middle of the day. The 20-year-old German, who made his Formula Two debut at the Sakhir circuit over the weekend and finished eighth and sixth in the two races, had been top with five minutes remaining before Verstappen went faster."}
